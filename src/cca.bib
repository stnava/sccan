	to identify related patterns of reduced white matter integrity, measured
	with the fractional anisotropy (FA) derived from diffusion tensor
	imaging (DTI), and decreases in cortical thickness, measured by high
	resolution T1-weighted imaging, in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal
	dementia (FTD). This process is based on a novel computational model
	derived from sparse canonical correlation analysis (SCCA) that allows
	us to automatically identify mutually predictive, distributed neuroanatomical
	regions from different imaging modalities. We apply the SCCA model
	to a dataset that includes 23 control subjects that are demographically
	matched to 49 subjects with autopsy or CSF-biomarker-diagnosed AD
	(n=24) and FTD (n=25) with both DTI and T1-weighted structural imaging.
	SCCA shows that the FTD-related frontal and temporal degeneration
	pattern is correlated across modalities with permutation corrected
	p<0.0005. In AD, we find significant association between cortical
	thinning and reduction in white matter integrity within a distributed
	parietal and temporal network (p<0.0005). Furthermore, we show that-within
	SCCA identified regions-significant differences exist between FTD
	and AD cortical-connective degeneration patterns. We validate these
	distinct, multimodal imaging patterns by showing unique relationships
	with cognitive measures in AD and FTD. We conclude that SCCA is a
	potentially valuable approach in image analysis that can be applied
	productively to distinguishing between neurodegenerative conditions.},

	networks, which are disrupted by the pathophysiological process of
	Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we used multivariate analytic
	techniques to investigate memory-related functional magnetic resonance
	imaging (fMRI) activity in 52 individuals across the continuum of
	normal aging, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and mild AD. Independent
	component analyses revealed specific memory-related networks that
	activated or deactivated during an associative memory paradigm. Across
	all subjects, hippocampal activation and parietal deactivation demonstrated
	a strong reciprocal relationship. Furthermore, we found evidence
	of a nonlinear trajectory of fMRI activation across the continuum
	of impairment. Less impaired MCI subjects showed paradoxical hyperactivation
	in the hippocampus compared with controls, whereas more impaired
	MCI subjects demonstrated significant hypoactivation, similar to
	the levels observed in the mild AD subjects. We found a remarkably
	parallel curve in the pattern of memory-related deactivation in medial
	and lateral parietal regions with greater deactivation in less-impaired
	MCI and loss of deactivation in more impaired MCI and mild AD subjects.
	Interestingly, the failure of deactivation in these regions was also
	associated with increased positive activity in a neocortical attentional
	network in MCI and AD. Our findings suggest that loss of functional
	integrity of the hippocampal-based memory systems is directly related
	to alterations of neural activity in parietal regions seen over the
	course of MCI and AD. These data may also provide functional evidence
	of the interaction between neocortical and medial temporal lobe pathology

	During functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning, young and

	matching, attentional cueing, and working memory. Accuracy of performance
	was roughly matched at 80\% across tasks and groups. Modulations
	of activity across conditions were assessed, as well as functional
	connectivity of both networks. Younger adults showed a broader engagement

	Functional connectivity in the DMN was reduced in older adults, whereas
	the main pattern of TPN connectivity was equivalent in the 2 groups.
	Age-specific connectivity also was seen in TPN regions. Increased
	activity in TPN areas predicted worse accuracy on the tasks, but
	greater expression of a connectivity pattern associated with a right
	dorsolateral prefrontal TPN region, seen only in older adults, predicted
	better performance. These results provide further evidence for age-related
	differences in the DMN and new evidence of age differences in the

	control processes in older individuals that may be partially offset
	by alterations in prefrontal functional connectivity.},

	memory/executive control, language, visuospatial operations, verbal/visual
	episodic memory, and behavior/social comportment and can be administered
	and scored in 15-20 min. Participants included 149 patients with
	AD and four groups of FTD patients - i.e., patients with a decline
	in social comportment, personality, and executive functioning (SOC/EXEC),
	semantic dementia (SemD), progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA), and
	corticobasal syndrome (CBS).The total PBAC score correlated with
	the Mini-Mental State Examination. Between-group analysis of PBAC
	subscales and the results of logistic regression analyses produced
	substantial between-group differences, emphasizing the sensitivity
	of the test to differentiate dementia subtypes. AD patients were
	impaired on tests of episodic memory, SOC/EXEC patients were impaired
	on a measure of social comportment/behavioral disturbance, PNFA patients
	obtained low scores on tests of working memory/executive control,
	SemD patients obtained lower scores on language-mediated measures,
	and CBS patients were impaired on visuospatial/visual memory tests.These
	data support the usefulness of the PBAC as a relatively brief screening
	test of overall dementia severity across a wide range of dementia
	patients.},

  abstract = {A key challenge for cognitive neuroscience is determining how mental
	representations map onto patterns of neural activity. Recently, researchers
	have started to address this question by applying sophisticated pattern-classification
	algorithms to distributed (multi-voxel) patterns of functional MRI
	data, with the goal of decoding the information that is represented
	in the subject's brain at a particular point in time. This multi-voxel
	pattern analysis (MVPA) approach has led to several impressive feats
	of mind reading. More importantly, MVPA methods constitute a useful
	new tool for advancing our understanding of neural information processing.
	We review how researchers are using MVPA methods to characterize
	neural coding and information processing in domains ranging from
	visual perception to memory search.},

	resonance imaging scans and compared between preterm and term children;
	correlations of regional brain volumes with cognitive measures (at
	age 8 years) and perinatal variables among preterm children.Regional
	cortical volumes were significantly smaller in the preterm children,

	were associated positively with full-scale, verbal, and performance
	IQ scores (P<.01 for all).Our data indicate that preterm birth is

  abstract = {Lesions of the cerebral white matter (WM) result in focal neurobehavioral
	syndromes, neuropsychiatric phenomena, and dementia. The cerebral
	WM contains fiber pathways that convey axons linking cerebral cortical
	areas with each other and with subcortical structures, facilitating
	the distributed neural circuits that subserve sensorimotor function,
	intellect, and emotion. Recent neuroanatomical investigations reveal
	that these neural circuits are topographically linked by five groupings
	of fiber tracts emanating from every neocortical area: (1) cortico-cortical
	association fibers; (2) corticostriatal fibers; (3) commissural fibers;
	and cortico-subcortical pathways to (4) thalamus and (5) pontocerebellar
	system, brain stem, and/or spinal cord. Lesions of association fibers
	prevent communication between cortical areas engaged in different
	domains of behavior. Lesions of subcortical structures or projection/striatal
	fibers disrupt the contribution of subcortical nodes to behavior.
	Disconnection syndromes thus result from lesions of the cerebral
	cortex, subcortical structures, and WM tracts that link the nodes
	that make up the distributed circuits. The nature and the severity
	of the clinical manifestations of WM lesions are determined, in large
	part, by the location of the pathology: discrete neurological and
	neuropsychiatric symptoms result from focal WM lesions, whereas cognitive
	impairment across multiple domains--WM dementia--occurs in the setting
	of diffuse WM disease. We present a detailed review of the conditions
	affecting WM that produce these neurobehavioral syndromes, and consider
	the pathophysiology, clinical effects, and broad significance of
	the effects of aging and vascular compromise on cerebral WM, in an
	attempt to help further the understanding, diagnosis, and treatment
	of these disorders.},
