  abstract = {We study the problem of detecting objects in still, gray-scale images.
	Our primary focus is the development of a learning-based approach
	to the problem that makes use of a sparse, part-based representation.
	A vocabulary of distinctive object parts is automatically constructed
	from a set of sample images of the object class of interest; images
	are then represented using parts from this vocabulary, together with
	spatial relations observed among the parts. Based on this representation,
	a learning algorithm is used to automatically learn to detect instances
	of the object class in new images. The approach can be applied to
	any object with distinguishable parts in a relatively fixed spatial
	configuration; it is evaluated here on difficult sets of real-world
	images containing side views of cars, and is seen to successfully
	detect objects in varying conditions amidst background clutter and
	mild occlusion. In evaluating object detection approaches, several
	important methodological issues arise that have not been satisfactorily
	addressed in previous work. A secondary focus of this paper is to
	highlight these issues and to develop rigorous evaluation standards
	for the object detection problem. A critical evaluation of our approach
	under the proposed standards is presented. © 2004 {IEEE.}},

	has contributed to the phenotypic characterisation of these patients.
	Complementary to the clinical and neuropsychological evaluations,
	structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional techniques
	provide important pieces of information for the diagnosis of FTLD.
	They also appear to be useful in distinguishing FTLD from patients
	with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Preliminary studies in pathologically
	proven cases suggested that distinct patterns of tissue loss could
	assist in predicting in vivo the pathological subtype. Recent years
	have also witnessed impressive advances in the development of novel
	imaging approaches. Diffusion tensor MRI and functional MRI have
	improved our understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease,
	and this should lead to the identification of additional useful markers
	of disease progression. This reviews discusses comprehensively the
	state-of-the-art of neuroimaging in the study of FTLD spectrum of
	disorders, and attempts to envisage which will be new neuroimaging
	biomarkers that could serve as surrogate measures of the underlying
	pathology. This will be central in the design of treatment trials

  abstract = {Cognitive deficits in semantic dementia have been attributed to anterior
	temporal lobe grey matter damage; however, key aspects of the syndrome
	could be due to altered anatomical connectivity between language
	pathways involving the temporal lobe. The aim of this study was to
	investigate the left language-related cerebral pathways in semantic
	dementia using diffusion tensor imaging-based tractography and to
	combine the findings with cortical anatomical and functional magnetic
	resonance imaging data obtained during a reading activation task.
	The left inferior longitudinal fasciculus, arcuate fasciculus and
	fronto-parietal superior longitudinal fasciculus were tracked in
	five semantic dementia patients and eight healthy controls. The left
	uncinate fasciculus and the genu and splenium of the corpus callosum
	were also obtained for comparison with previous studies. From each
	tract, mean diffusivity, fractional anisotropy, as well as parallel
	and transverse diffusivities were obtained. Diffusion tensor imaging
	results were related to grey and white matter atrophy volume assessed
	by voxel-based morphometry and functional magnetic resonance imaging
	activations during a reading task. Semantic dementia patients had
	significantly higher mean diffusivity, parallel and transverse in
	the inferior longitudinal fasciculus. The arcuate and uncinate fasciculi
	demonstrated significantly higher mean diffusivity, parallel and
	transverse and significantly lower fractional anisotropy. The fronto-parietal
	superior longitudinal fasciculus was relatively spared, with a significant
	difference observed for transverse diffusivity and fractional anisotropy,
	only. In the corpus callosum, the genu showed lower fractional anisotropy
	compared with controls, while no difference was found in the splenium.
	The left parietal cortex did not show significant volume changes
	on voxel-based morphometry and demonstrated normal functional magnetic
	resonance imaging activation in response to reading items that stress
	sublexical phonological processing. This study shows that semantic
	dementia is associated with anatomical damage to the major superior
	and inferior temporal white matter connections of the left hemisphere

	Patients with bvFTD showed widespread diffusion tensor magnetic resonance

	In PPA patients, WM damage was more focal and varied across the 3
	syndromes: left frontotemporoparietal in nonfluent, left frontotemporal
	in semantic, and left frontoparietal in logopenic patients. In each
	syndrome, DT MRI changes extended beyond the topography of gray matter
	loss. Left uncinate damage was the best predictor of frontotemporal
	lobar degeneration diagnosis versus controls. DT MRI measures of
	the anterior corpus callosum and left superior longitudinal fasciculus
	differentiated bvFTD from nonfluent cases. The best predictors of
	semantic PPA compared with both bvFTD and nonfluent cases were diffusivity
	abnormalities of the left uncinate and inferior longitudinal fasciculus.
	This study provides insights into the similarities and differences

  abstract = {RPE65 is an essential molecule in the retinoid-visual cycle, and
	RPE65 gene mutations cause the congenital human blindness known as
	Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA). Somatic gene therapy delivered
	to the retina of blind dogs with an RPE65 mutation dramatically restores
	retinal physiology and has sparked international interest in human
	treatment trials for this incurable disease. An unanswered question
	is how the visual cortex responds after prolonged sensory deprivation
	from retinal dysfunction. We therefore studied the cortex of RPE65-mutant
	dogs before and after retinal gene therapy. Then, we inquired whether
	there is visual pathway integrity and responsivity in adult humans
	with LCA due to RPE65 mutations (RPE65-LCA).RPE65-mutant dogs were
	studied with fMRI. Prior to therapy, retinal and subcortical responses
	to light were markedly diminished, and there were minimal cortical
	responses within the primary visual areas of the lateral gyrus (activation
	amplitude mean +/- standard deviation [SD] = 0.07\% +/- 0.06\% and
	volume = 1.3 +/- 0.6 cm(3)). Following therapy, retinal and subcortical
	response restoration was accompanied by increased amplitude (0.18\%
	+/- 0.06\%) and volume (8.2 +/- 0.8 cm(3)) of activation within the
	lateral gyrus (p < 0.005 for both). Cortical recovery occurred rapidly
	(within a month of treatment) and was persistent (as long as 2.5
	y after treatment). Recovery was present even when treatment was
	provided as late as 1-4 y of age. Human RPE65-LCA patients (ages
	18-23 y) were studied with structural magnetic resonance imaging.
	Optic nerve diameter (3.2 +/- 0.5 mm) was within the normal range
	(3.2 +/- 0.3 mm), and occipital cortical white matter density as
	judged by voxel-based morphometry was slightly but significantly
	altered (1.3 SD below control average, p = 0.005). Functional magnetic
	resonance imaging in human RPE65-LCA patients revealed cortical responses
	with a markedly diminished activation volume (8.8 +/- 1.2 cm(3))
	compared to controls (29.7 +/- 8.3 cm(3), p < 0.001) when stimulated
	with lower intensity light. Unexpectedly, cortical response volume
	(41.2 +/- 11.1 cm(3)) was comparable to normal (48.8 +/- 3.1 cm(3),
	p = 0.2) with higher intensity light stimulation.Visual cortical
	responses dramatically improve after retinal gene therapy in the
	canine model of RPE65-LCA. Human RPE65-LCA patients have preserved
	visual pathway anatomy and detectable cortical activation despite
	limited visual experience. Taken together, the results support the
	potential for human visual benefit from retinal therapies currently
	being aimed at restoring vision to the congenitally blind with genetic
	retinal disease.},

	to understand the neuropathological consequences of loss of PGRN
	function throughout the lifespan of GRN-deficient ((-/+) and (-/-))
	mice. An aged series of GRN-deficient and wild-type mice were compared
	by histology, immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopy. Although
	GRN-deficient mice were viable, GRN(-/-) mice were produced at lower
	than predicted frequency. Neuropathologically, GRN(-/+) were indistinguishable
	from controls; however, GRN(-/-) mice developed age-associated, abnormal

	was noted in aged GRN(+/+) mice at levels comparable with those of
	young GRN(-/-) mice. GRN(-/-) mice developed microgliosis, astrogliosis,
	and tissue vacuolation, with focal neuronal loss and severe gliosis

	lipofuscinosis and ubiquitination in GRN(-/-) mice is strikingly
	similar to changes associated with aging and cellular decline in

	scans were acquired for 19 children and adolescents with {ASD} ({\textasciitilde}8-18

	increases in mean and radial diffusivity in {ASD} children were prominent

  abstract = {We present a review of the literature on Primary Progressive Aphasia
	(PPA) together with the analysis of neuropschychological and neuroradiologic

	progressive degenerative disorder characterized by isolated language
	impairment for at least two years. The most common variants of PPA
	are: 1) Progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA), 2) semantic dementia
	(SD), 3) logopenic progressive aphasia (LPA). PNFA is characterized
	by labored speech, agrammatism in production, and/or comprehension.
	In some cases the syndrome begins with isolated deficits in speech.
	SD patients typically present with loss of word and object meaning
	and surface dyslexia. LPA patients have word-finding difficulties,
	syntactically simple but accurate language output and impaired sentence
	comprehension. The neuropsychological data demonstrated that SD patients
	show the most characteristic pattern of impairment, while PNFA and
	LPA overlap within many cognitive domains. The neuroimaging analysis
	showed left perisylvian region involvement. A comprehensive cognitive,
	neuroimaging and pathological approach is necessary to identify the
	clinical and pathogenetic features of different PPA variants.},

	repetition and the left posterior portion of the superior temporal
	gyrus; (3) sentence comprehension and the left dorsal middle and

	polyethylene glycol (Carbowax), sectioned coronally, and stained
	with thioflavin S and thionin. The densities of NFTs and NPs were
	assessed using a numerical rating scale for each area. Scores were
	grouped by type of cortex and by lobe for statistical analysis. Highly
	significant differences were obtained. For example, limbic periallocortex
	and allocortex had more NFTs than any other type of cortex. In descending
	order, the density of NFTs was as follows: periallocortex (area 28)
	greater than allocortex (subiculum/CA1 zones of hippocampal formation,
	area 51) greater than corticoid areas (accessory basal nucleus of
	amygdala, nucleus basalis of Meynert) greater than proisocortex (areas
	11, 12, 24, 23, anterior insula, 38, 35) greater than nonprimary
	association cortex (32, 46, superior temporal sulcus, 40, 39, posterior
	parahippocampal cortex, 37, 36) greater than primary sensory association
	cortex (7, 18, 19, 22, 21, 20) greater than agranular cortex (44-5,
	8, 6, 4) greater than primary sensory cortex (41-2, 3-1-2, 17). The
	laminar distribution of NFTs tended to be selective, involving primarily
	layers III and V of association areas and layers II and IV of limbic
	periallocortex. There were far more NFTs in both limbic and temporal
	lobes than in frontal, parietal, and occipital lobes. In general,
	NPs were more evenly distributed throughout the cortex, with the
	exceptions of limbic periallocortex and allocortex, which had notably
	fewer NPs than other cortical areas. Temporal and occipital lobes
	had the highest NP densities, limbic and frontal lobes had the lowest,
	and parietal lobe was intermediate. No significant left-right hemispheric
	differences for NFT or NP densities were found across the population,
	and there was no relationship between duration of illness and densities
	of NFTs or NPs. The regional and laminar distribution of NFTs (and,
	to a lesser degree, that of NPs) suggests a consistent pattern of
	vulnerability within the cerebral cortices that seems correlated
	to the hierarchies of cortico-cortical connections. The higher-order
	association cortices, especially those in the anterior and ventromedial
	sectors of temporal lobe, are the most vulnerable, while other cortices
	appear less vulnerable to a degree commensurate with their connectional
	"distance" (i.e., synapses removed) from the limbic areas.},

	DESIGN: Examination of degenerative changes, neurofibrillary tangles,
	and senile plaques in the temporal poles of 10 patients with AD,
	three patients with PD, and five age-compatible control subjects,
	by means of thionein and thioflavine S stains and Alz-50 and ubiquitin

	of dementia and AD or PD confirmed on neuropathologic examination.
	Control subjects were without a history of cognitive impairment or
	evident neuropathologic changes. OUTCOME MEASURES: Cytoarchitecture,
	neuronal loss, neurofibrillary tangles, senile plaques, and Pick
	bodies. RESULTS: All patients with AD showed atrophy of the temporal
	pole and marked neuronal loss, especially in layers III and V and,
	to a lesser degree, in layers II and VI. Heavy accumulation of neurofibrillary
	tangles was found in layers II, III, V, and VI. Patients with PD
	showed extensive neuron loss throughout, although this appeared to
	be most prominent in layer III. CONCLUSIONS: Both AD and PD pathologic
	changes severely affect the layers of the temporal pole that mediate
	widespread reciprocal connections with temporal and frontal cortices
	and limbic cortical and subcortical structures. Neural systems that
	interconnect temporal polar cortex with sensory association areas
	and memory-related limbic structures are, therefore, disrupted, and
	it is likely that these lesions play a role in the multifaceted cognitive
	and behavioral changes of AD and PD.},

	language-based deformations that nevertheless result in possible
	sequences of English speech segments; or phonetic, involving a motor
	planning deficit and resulting in non-English speech segments. The
	distribution of cortical atrophy as revealed by structural MRI scans

	few errors made by healthy seniors were only phonemic in type. PNFA
	patients made more than four times as many errors as controls. This
	included both phonemic and phonetic errors, with a preponderance
	of errors (82\%) classified as phonemic. The majority of phonemic
	errors were substitutions that shared most distinctive features with
	the target phoneme. The systematic nature of these substitutions
	is not consistent with a motor planning deficit. Cortical atrophy
	was found in prefrontal regions bilaterally and peri-Sylvian regions

  abstract = {We investigated the cognitive and neural bases of impaired speech
	fluency, a central feature of primary progressive aphasia. Speech
	fluency was assessed in 35 patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration
	(FTLD) who presented with progressive non-fluent aphasia (PNFA, n=11),
	semantic dementia (SemD, n=12), or a social and executive disorder
	without aphasia (SOC/EXEC, n=12). Fluency was quantified as the number
	of words per minute in an extended, semi-structured speech sample.
	This was related to language characteristics of the speech sample
	and to neuropsychological measures. PNFA patients were significantly
	less fluent than controls and other FTLD patients. Fluency correlated
	with grammatical expression but not with speech errors or executive
	difficulty. SemD and SOC/EXEC patients were also less fluent than
	controls. In SemD, fluency was associated with semantically limited
	content. In SOC/EXEC, fluency was associated with executive limitations.
	Voxel-based morphometry analyses of high-resolution MRI related fluency
	to gray matter volume in left inferior frontal, insula, and superior
	temporal regions for the entire cohort of FTLD patients. This region
	overlapped partially distinct atrophic areas in each FTLD subgroup.
	It thus appears to play a crucial role in speech fluency, which can
	be interrupted in different ways in different FTLD subgroups.},

	is of no consequence when using actual data. We first review the

  abstract = {At its simplest, voxel-based morphometry {(VBM)} involves a voxel-wise
	comparison of the local concentration of gray matter between two
	groups of subjects. The procedure is relatively straightforward and
	involves spatially normalizing high-resolution images from all the
	subjects in the study into the same stereotactic space. This is followed
	by segmenting the gray matter from the spatially normalized images
	and smoothing the gray-matter segments. Voxel-wise parametric statistical
	tests which compare the smoothed gray-matter images from the two
	groups are performed. Corrections for multiple comparisons are made
	using the theory of Gaussian random fields. This paper describes
	the steps involved in {VBM}, with particular emphasis on segmenting
	gray matter from {MR} images with nonuniformity artifact. We provide
	evaluations of the assumptions that underpin the method, including
	the accuracy of the segmentation and the assumptions made about the

	use on adolescent brain development, particularly on the hippocampus.
	In this preliminary study, we compared hippocampal morphology in
	14 "treatment-seeking" adolescents (aged 18-20) with a history of
	prior heavy cannabis use (5.8 joints/day) after an average of 6.7
	months of drug abstinence, and 14 demographically matched normal
	controls. Participants underwent a high-resolution 3D MRI as well
	as cognitive testing including the California Verbal Learning Test
	(CVLT). Heavy-cannabis users showed significantly smaller volumes
	of the right (p < 0.04) and left (p < 0.02) hippocampus, but no significant
	differences in the amygdala region compared to controls. In controls,
	larger hippocampus volumes were observed to be significantly correlated
	with higher CVLT verbal learning and memory scores, but these relationships
	were not observed in cannabis users. In cannabis users, a smaller
	right hippocampus volume was correlated with a higher amount of cannabis
	use (r = -0.57, p < 0.03). These data support a hypothesis that heavy
	cannabis use may have an adverse effect on hippocampus development.
	These findings, after an average 6.7 month of supervised abstinence,
	lend support to a theory that cannabis use may impart long-term structural
	and functional damage. Alternatively, the observed hippocampal volumetric
	abnormalities may represent a risk factor for cannabis dependence.
	These data have potential significance for understanding the observed
	relationship between early cannabis exposure during adolescence and
	subsequent development of adult psychopathology reported in the literature
	for schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders.},

	correction, consistent longitudinal segmentation, cortical parcellation
	and cortical thickness estimation are all based on strong use of
	the subject-specific priors built from initial diffeomorphic mapping
	between the SST and optimal group template. We evaluate our approach
	with both test-retest data and with application to a driving biological
	problem. We use test-retest data to show that this approach produces
	(a) zero change when the retest data contains the same image content
	as the test data and (b) produces normally distributed, low variance
	estimates of thickness change centered at zero when test-retest data
	is collected near in time to test data. We also show that our approach--when
	combined with sparse canonical correlation analysis--reveals plausible,
	significant, annualized decline in cortical thickness and white matter
	volume when contrasting frontotemporal dementia and normal aging.},

	the standard order of operations by first clustering the voxel data
	and then using standard linear regression in this reduced dimensionality

	constructing a local neighborhood from image information, such as
	a segmentation or edge map, to define a surface patch. Neighborhood
	constructions using extrinsic and intrinsic distances are given.
	This representation allows one to estimate differential properties
	directly from the image's Gauss map. We develop a novel technique
	for this purpose which estimates the shape operator and yields both
	principal directions and curvatures. Only first derivatives need
	be estimated, making the method numerically stable. We show the use
	of these measures for multi-scale classification of image structure
	by the mean and Gaussian curvatures. Finally, we propose to register
	image volumes by surface curvature. This is particularly useful when
	geometry is the only variable. To illustrate this, we register binary
	segmented data by surface curvature, both rigidly and non-rigidly.
	A novel variant of Demons registration, extensible for use with differentiable
	similarity metrics, is also applied for deformable curvature-driven

	effects secondary to fetal hypoxemia, or altered cerebrovascular

	detriments to the dopaminergic system. The right (P < 0.025) and

	reproducibility in the biomedical imaging sciences. Here, we report
	and evaluate a recent product of this commitment: Advanced Neuroimaging
	Tools (ANTs), which is approaching its 2.0 release. The ANTs open
	source software library consists of a suite of state-of-the-art image
	registration, segmentation and template building tools for quantitative
	morphometric analysis. In this work, we use ANTs to quantify, for
	the first time, the impact of similarity metrics on the affine and
	deformable components of a template-based normalization study. We
	detail the ANTs implementation of three similarity metrics: squared
	intensity difference, a new and faster cross-correlation, and voxel-wise
	mutual information. We then use two-fold cross-validation to compare
	their performance on openly available, manually labeled, T1-weighted
	MRI brain image data of 40 subjects (UCLA's LPBA40 dataset). We report
	evaluation results on cortical and whole brain labels for both the
	affine and deformable components of the registration. Results indicate
	that the best ANTs methods are competitive with existing brain extraction
	results (Jaccard=0.958) and cortical labeling approaches. Mutual
	information affine mapping combined with cross-correlation diffeomorphic
	mapping gave the best cortical labeling results (Jaccard=0.669±0.022).
	Furthermore, our two-fold cross-validation allows us to quantify
	the similarity of templates derived from different subgroups. Our
	open code, data and evaluation scripts set performance benchmark
	parameters for this state-of-the-art toolkit. This is the first study
	to use a consistent transformation framework to provide a reproducible
	evaluation of the isolated effect of the similarity metric on optimal
	template construction and brain labeling.},

	The Bayesian formulation of the segmentation problem is solved using

	the class intensities based on either parametric or non-parametric
	finite mixtures. Atropos is capable of incorporating spatial prior
	probability maps (sparse), prior label maps and/or Markov Random
	Field (MRF) modeling. Atropos has also been efficiently implemented
	to handle large quantities of possible labelings (in the experimental
	section, we use up to 69 classes) with a minimal memory footprint.
	This work describes the technical and implementation aspects of Atropos
	and evaluates its performance on two different ground-truth datasets.
	First, we use the BrainWeb dataset from Montreal Neurological Institute
	to evaluate three-tissue segmentation performance via (1) K-means
	segmentation without use of template data; (2) MRF segmentation with
	initialization by prior probability maps derived from a group template;
	(3) Prior-based segmentation with use of spatial prior probability
	maps derived from a group template. We also evaluate Atropos performance
	by using spatial priors to drive a 69-class EM segmentation problem
	derived from the Hammers atlas from University College London. These

	Atropos options, demonstrate both performance and wide applicability

  abstract = {Sophisticated image analysis methods have been developed for the
	human brain, but such tools still need to be adapted and optimized
	for quantitative small animal imaging. We propose a framework for
	quantitative anatomical phenotyping in mouse models of neurological
	and psychiatric conditions. The framework encompasses an atlas space,
	image acquisition protocols, and software tools to register images
	into this space. We show that a suite of segmentation tools (Avants,
	Epstein et al., 2008) designed for human neuroimaging can be incorporated
	into a pipeline for segmenting mouse brain images acquired with multispectral
	magnetic resonance imaging (MR) protocols. We present a flexible
	approach for segmenting such hyperimages, optimizing registration,
	and identifying optimal combinations of image channels for particular
	structures. Brain imaging with T1, T2* and T2 contrasts yielded accuracy
	in the range of 83\% for hippocampus and caudate putamen (Hc and
	CPu), but only 54\% in white matter tracts, and 44\% for the ventricles.
	The addition of diffusion tensor parameter images improved accuracy
	for large gray matter structures (by >5\%), white matter (10\%),
	and ventricles (15\%). The use of Markov random field segmentation
	further improved overall accuracy in the C57BL/6 strain by 6\%; so
	Dice coefficients for Hc and CPu reached 93\%, for white matter 79\%,
	for ventricles 68\%, and for substantia nigra 80\%. We demonstrate
	the segmentation pipeline for the widely used C57BL/6 strain, and
	two test strains (BXD29, APP/TTA). This approach appears promising
	for characterizing temporal changes in mouse models of human neurological
	and psychiatric conditions, and may provide anatomical constraints
	for other preclinical imaging, e.g. fMRI and molecular imaging. This
	is the first demonstration that multiple MR imaging modalities combined
	with multivariate segmentation methods lead to significant improvements
	in anatomical segmentation in the mouse brain.},

  abstract = {Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is the second most common cause of
	dementia in people under the age of 65 years. A large proportion
	of FTD patients (35-50\%) have a family history of dementia, consistent
	with a strong genetic component to the disease. In 1998, mutations
	in the gene encoding the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT)
	were shown to cause familial FTD with parkinsonism linked to chromosome
	17q21 (FTDP-17). The neuropathology of patients with defined MAPT
	mutations is characterized by cytoplasmic neurofibrillary inclusions
	composed of hyperphosphorylated tau. However, in multiple FTD families
	with significant evidence for linkage to the same region on chromosome
	17q21 (D17S1787-D17S806), mutations in MAPT have not been found and
	the patients consistently lack tau-immunoreactive inclusion pathology.
	In contrast, these patients have ubiquitin (ub)-immunoreactive neuronal
	cytoplasmic inclusions and characteristic lentiform ub-immunoreactive
	neuronal intranuclear inclusions. Here we demonstrate that in these
	families, FTD is caused by mutations in progranulin (PGRN) that are
	likely to create null alleles. PGRN is located 1.7 Mb centromeric
	of MAPT on chromosome 17q21.31 and encodes a 68.5-kDa secreted growth
	factor involved in the regulation of multiple processes including
	development, wound repair and inflammation. PGRN has also been strongly
	linked to tumorigenesis. Moreover, PGRN expression is increased in
	activated microglia in many neurodegenerative diseases including
	Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, motor neuron disease and Alzheimer's disease.
	Our results identify mutations in PGRN as a cause of neurodegenerative
	disease and indicate the importance of PGRN function for neuronal
	survival.},

  abstract = {BET (Brain Extraction Tool) is a widely used computer program to
	automatically separate brain from non-brain structures in MR images.
	This procedure is used in SIENAX and SIENA, which are robust approaches
	to quantifying brain volume (atrophy state) and volume change (atrophy
	rate), respectively. Occasionally, however, BET produces imperfect
	results (e.g., inclusion of non-brain structures). This is usually
	either ignored (if inaccuracies are small) or corrected by manual
	adjustment, with the disadvantages of user intervention. We describe
	here a new, automated option in BET. This is based on the original
	BET, but uses standard-space masking to remove tissue around the
	eyes, and further morphological operations and thresholding to refine
	eyeball removal and eliminate additional non-brain tissues. To assess
	whether the new BET procedure improves brain volume measurements,
	this was compared with the traditional and manual editing procedures
	in SIENA and SIENAX. Measures of atrophy rate and state were significantly
	higher with the traditional procedure than with the manual editing
	and new procedures. In contrast, both atrophy measures were almost
	identical and highly correlated when the manual editing and new procedures
	were used. The voxels excluded with these two procedures showed close
	overlap, as judged by the Dice overlap coefficient. We conclude that,
	in SIENA and SIENAX, the proposed BET procedure shows results matching
	those obtained after manual editing, thus more closely approximating
	the "true" brain volume. Multicentre studies monitoring brain atrophy
	in clinical trials may receive benefit by using this unbiased, fully

	manipulable objects (tools)-are easily recognized by either their
	auditory or visual features. Although these features differ across
	modalities, the brain integrates them into a coherent percept. In
	three separate f{M}{R}{I} experiments, posterior superior temporal
	sulcus and middle temporal gyrus (pSTS/MTG) fulfilled objective criteria
	for an integration site. pSTS/MTG showed signal increases in response
	to either auditory or visual stimuli and responded more to auditory
	or visual objects than to meaningless (but complex) control stimuli.
	pSTS/MTG showed an enhanced response when auditory and visual object
	features were presented together, relative to presentation in a single
	modality. Finally, pSTS/MTG responded more to object identification
	than to other components of the behavioral task. We suggest that
	pSTS/MTG is specialized for integrating different types of information
	both within modalities (e.g., visual form, visual motion) and across

  abstract = {We examined the role of the posterior division of the paraventricular
	nucleus of the thalamus (pPVTh) in habituation of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
	(HPA) responses to repeated restraint. Habituation refers to the
	decrement in HPA activity that occurs with repeated exposure to the
	same or homotypic stressor. To date, the pPVTh has been shown to
	inhibit the enhanced or facilitated HPA responses to novel, heterotypic
	restraint in previously chronically cold stressed rats. We hypothesized
	that the pPVTh also inhibits HPA activity under conditions of habituation.
	In the first experiment, we lesioned the pPVTh and examined adrenocorticotropic
	hormone (ACTH) and corticosterone responses to the first or eighth
	restraint exposure. In sham-lesioned rats, we found lower ACTH and
	corticosterone responses to the eighth period of 30 min restraint
	compared to the first exposure, evidence for habituation. In pPVTh-lesioned
	rats, there was no difference in ACTH and corticosterone responses
	to the eighth compared to the first restraint exposure. Therefore,
	pPVTh lesions prevented the habituation of HPA responses to repeated
	restraint. In the second experiment, we examined whether habituation
	to restraint is observable in response to an acute, single restraint
	on day 28 in sham and pPVTh lesioned rats that were exposed to restraint
	only on days 1 through 8. In this experiment, we replicated the results
	from the first experiment, and found evidence that habituation to
	restraint can be observed weeks after chronic stress has been terminated.
	Furthermore, pPVTh lesions had no additional effects on HPA responses
	to acute stress on day 28. In summary, pPVTh lesions inhibit habituation
	of HPA activity to a homotypic stressor, without altering HPA responses
	to the first restraint. Thus, the intact pPVTh inhibits HPA activity
	under conditions of habituation, as well as facilitation, and represents
	an important regulator of HPA activity under conditions of chronic
	stress.},

	(HPA) activity and body temperature in response to acute social defeat,
	to repeated social stress and to novel restraint after repeated stress,
	as well as to assess effects on metabolic parameters by measuring
	body weight gain and food and water intake. We found that social
	defeat produced a marked increase in both adrenocorticotrophic hormone
	and corticosterone compared to placement in a novel cage. Similarly,
	body temperature was also increased during social defeat and during
	30 min of recovery from defeat. We then examined the effects of 6
	days of repeated social stress and observed minimal HPA responses
	to repeated social stress compared to control rats. These neuroendocrine
	responses were contrasted by robust increases in body temperature
	during stress and during recovery from stress during 6 days of repeated
	stress. However, in response to novel restraint, repeatedly stressed
	rats displayed facilitated body temperature responses compared to
	controls, similar to our previous findings with HPA activity. Food
	intake was increased during the light period during which defeat
	took place, but later intake during the dark period was not affected.
	Repeated stress decreased body weight gain in the dark period but
	food intake was increased overall during the 6 days of repeated stress
	in the light period. As a result, repeated stress increased cumulative
	food intake during the light period in the stressed rats but these
	relatively small increases in food intake were unable to prevent
	the diminished total weight gain in repeatedly stressed rats. Overall,
	the results demonstrate that, although acute social defeat has similar
	effects on temperature and HPA activity, repeated exposure to social
	stress has divergent effects on HPA activity compared to body temperature
	and that dampened weight gain produced by repeated social stress
	cannot be fully explained by changes in food intake.},

	a diagnostic lumbar puncture and was analyzed using assays for total
	tau and amyloid-beta 1-42 (A beta(42)). Patients also were assessed
	with a brief neuropsychological battery. RESULTS: {C}{S}{F} total
	tau level and the ratio of {C}{S}{F} total tau to A beta(42) (tau/A
	beta(42)) were significantly lower in FTLD than in AD. Receiver operating
	characteristic curve analyses confirmed that the {C}{S}{F} tau/A
	beta(42) ratio is sensitive and specific at discriminating between
	FTLD and AD, and is more successful at this than {C}{S}{F} total
	tau alone. Although some neuropsychological measures are significantly
	different in autopsy-proven FTLD and AD, combining these neuropsychological
	measures with {C}{S}{F} biomarkers did not improve the ability to
	distinguish FTLD from AD. CONCLUSIONS: The ratio of {C}{S}{F} tau/A
	beta(42) is a sensitive and specific biomarker at discriminating
	frontotemporal lobar degeneration from {A}lzheimer disease in patients
	with known pathology.},

	Frontal, temporal and hippocampal atrophy was measured from {M}{R}{I}
	of 10 FTD patients, 27 AD, and 27 controls. Corrected atrophy and
	asymmetry were computed (W-scores). RESULTS: FTD had mild atrophy
	in the hippocampus (average W-score=-1.3), severe in the frontal
	(W-score=-2.4) and very severe in the temporal lobes (W-score=-2.9).
	AD had moderate atrophy in the hippocampus and temporal lobes (W-score=-1.8
	and -1.9, respectively), and very mild frontal atrophy (W-score=-0.9).
	Atrophy was more asymmetrical in FTD (left more atrophic) than in
	AD patients, particularly in the temporal lobes. A discriminant function
	including the asymmetry values of frontal and temporal regions could
	separate FTD from AD with 90\% sensitivity and 93\% specificity.
	CONCLUSIONS: FTD is characterized by a specific pattern of atrophy,

	of relatively common neurodegenerative disorders. The aim of this
	study was to characterize the patterns of brain atrophy in FTD compared
	to {A}lzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: A novel semiautomatic volumetric
	{M}{R}{I} analysis method was applied to measure regional brain volumes
	in FTD (n = 15; behavioural variant n = 9, language variant n = 6)
	in contrast with AD patients (n = 15) and age-matched controls (NC)
	(n = 15). FTD and AD patients were matched on demographic measures
	and Mini Mental State Examination scores. RESULTS: Significant atrophy
	was present in the frontal and anterior temporal lobes of subjects
	with FTD compared to AD (p = 0.02; effect size = 1.11) and compared
	to NC (p < 0.001; effect size = 1.86). Severe atrophy of the left
	anterior temporal region distinguished the language variant. AD patients,
	by contrast, did not differ from NC for frontal lobe volume but had
	smaller anterior temporal lobes (p = 0.03). Both dementia groups
	had medial temporal lobe atrophy of similar magnitude. A logistic
	regression model including 4 regional measures correctly classified
	100\% of subjects. CONCLUSION: FTD can be reliably differentiated
	from AD by virtue of a topographical pattern of atrophy involving
	the frontal lobes and anterior temporal regions. Medial temporal
	lobe volumes do not distinguish FTD from AD.},

  abstract = {The background to this study began with the reporting of two Japanese
	kindreds with the S305N tau mutation. Although the pathological findings
	in the autopsied cases were well characterized, only limited ante-mortem
	data were presented. In this study, longitudinal characterization
	was carried out in two siblings of European ancestry found to have
	frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17
	(FTDP-17) through comprehensive neurobehavioural examinations and
	other scales at approximate 6-month intervals. Scales included the
	Mini-Mental State Examination, Short Test of Mental Status, modified
	motor subtest of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, detailed
	neuropsychological testing, and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory. Changes
	in whole-brain volume and ventricular volume were measured from serial
	MRI studies. All members of the kindred underwent molecular genetic
	analyses to elucidate the mechanism of inheritance. The missense
	mutation in tau, S305N, was detected in the proband (onset age 30),
	who has undergone serial evaluations for almost 4 years. Her older
	sister (onset age 36) was subsequently found to have the same mutation,
	and has undergone serial evaluations for 2 years. This mutation is
	absent in both parents and the only other sibling, and non-paternity
	was excluded by additional analyses. The siblings have exhibited
	cognitive and behavioural features typical of FTDP-17, which have
	proved challenging to manage despite aggressive pharmacological and
	behavioural therapies. The proband's sister has demonstrated an atypical
	profile of impairment on neuropsychological testing. Both siblings
	have developed striking atrophy of the anterior part of temporal
	lobes and moderate atrophy of the dorsolateral and orbitofrontal
	cortical regions, which in both cases is relatively symmetrical.
	The annualized changes in whole-brain volume and ventricular volume,
	respectively, were -35.2 ml/year (3.23\% decrease per year) and +20.75
	ml/year (16.93\% increase per year) for the proband, and -30.75 ml/year
	(2.77\% decrease per year) and +5.01 ml/year (3.11\% increase per
	year) for the proband's sister. In conclusion, the mutation in these
	siblings may have arisen during oogenesis in the mother and probably
	represents germline mosaicism. Although both patients have exhibited
	the typical cognitive and behavioural features of FTDP-17, one patient
	is exhibiting an atypical neuropsychological profile. Also, despite
	a similar topographic pattern of progressive atrophy on MRI, the
	rates of change in whole-brain volume and ventricular volume between
	the two patients are quite different. These findings have implications
	for future drug trial development in FTDP-17 and the sporadic tauopathies.},

	diagnosis between {A}lzheimer's and frontotemporal disease. The impending
	availability of effective treatment for {A}lzheimer's disease makes
	this differential diagnosis important. Methods: Images of 20 patients
	with clinically confirmed or autopsy-proven (10 patients) {A}lzheimer's
	disease and 20 patients with clinically confirmed or autopsy-proven
	(7 patients) frontotemporal disease were compared with the consolidated
	images of 20 elderly healthy control subjects. The 99mTc-hexamethylpropyleneamine
	oxime SPECT data on brain blood flow from each patient were compared
	with the consolidated control image using statistical parametric
	mapping. Results: Sixteen of 20 patients with {A}lzheimer's disease
	showed the posterior cingulate sign in the form of significant blood
	flow reductions; 1 of 20 patients with frontotemporal disease showed
	the posterior cingulate sign. That patient's illness has evolved
	into {A}lzheimer's disease. The remaining 19 patients were negative
	for the posterior cingulate sign. Conclusion: When present, the posterior
	cingulate sign indicates the presence of {A}lzheimer's disease; it
	is apparently absent in frontotemporal disease, thus serving as a
	differential diagnostic sign. It was absent in 3 patients with proven
	tangle-predominant {A}lzheimer's disease.},

	(GM) tissue organization in patients with fvFTD and tvFTD by means
	of diffusion tensor imaging and voxel-based morphometry, and the
	correlations with neuropsychological and behavioral variables. DESIGN
	AND SETTING: Frontotemporal dementia clinic-based cohort and structural
	magnetic resonance imaging acquisition for voxel-based morphometry
	and diffusion tensor imaging measurements. Abnormalities were detected
	by a comparison with healthy control subjects. These variables were
	also correlated with clinical scores. Patients Thirty-six patients
	(28 with fvFTD and 8 with tvFTD) in early disease stage and 23 healthy
	controls who underwent standardized clinical and neuropsychological
	evaluation and magnetic resonance imaging. INTERVENTIONS: Diffusion
	tensor imaging and voxel-based morphometry. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:
	Neuroimaging analyses resulted in localized GM atrophy and reductions
	of white matter densities; the latter correlated with behavioral
	scores. RESULTS: Voxel-based morphometry analysis showed separate
	patterns of GM atrophy in the 2 groups. Diffusion tensor imaging
	showed different WM reduction patterns in patients with fvFTD and
	tvFTD. The fvFTD group showed a selective WM reduction in the superior
	longitudinal fasciculus, interconnecting the frontal and occipital
	and the temporal and parietal regions. Conversely, patients with
	tvFTD were characterized by WM reductions in the inferior longitudinal
	fasciculus, which affected the connections between anterior temporal
	and frontal regions. The WM reductions in fvFTD paralleled both behavioral
	disturbances measured by Frontal Behavioral Inventory and neuropsychological
	deficits affecting frontal functions. CONCLUSIONS: The fvFTD and
	tvFTD variants are associated not only with selective local GM reductions
	but also with significant WM damage in early disease phase. The different
	WM patterns contribute to the different clinical syndromes in FTD
	and could be responsible for the further progression of atrophy in
	the later disease stages.},

	found to be significantly associated with an earlier age of onset

	3q27 region are common in B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma of germinal
	center cell origin. Grade {3B} follicular lymphoma {(FL)}, consisting

	lymphomas that has more in common clinically with the aggressive

	1 and 2 counterparts. We studied the cytogenetic and molecular genetic
	aberrations by classic cytogenetics, polymerase chain reaction, Southern
	blot hybridization, and fluorescence in situ hybridization, with
	special emphasis on t(14;18), affecting bcl-2, and 3q27 rearrangement,
	affecting bcl-6, in 32 cases of {FL} grade {3B.} Three distinctive
	subgroups were identified based upon the existence of breakpoint
	3q27, a translocation t(14;18), or the absence of both. Group I involved
	a t(14;18) and no 3q27 aberrations (n = 13); group {II} was without
	a t(14;18) and without 3q27 aberrations (n = 9), but had other cytogenetic
	aberrations; and group {III} was without a t(14;18) but with aberrations
	involving 3q27 (n = 10). None of the {FL} grade {3B} cases harbored
	both a t(14;18) and 3q27 aberration. These results, in particular
	the finding of a mutual exclusiveness of bcl-2 and bcl-6 rearrangement,
	indicate at least 3 different pathways of oncogenesis in {FL} grade
	{3B.} {FL} grade {3B} with bcl-2 rearrangement probably is part of
	the same entity as the other follicular lymphomas (1, 2, {3A)}, whereas

	a heritable form of FTD, but the gene(s) responsible for the majority
	of autosomal dominant FTD-ALS cases have yet to be found. Previous
	studies have identified a region on chromosome 9p that is associated
	with FTD and ALS.The authors report the clinical, volumetric MRI,
	neuropathological and genetic features of a new chromosome 9p-linked
	FTD-ALS family, VSM-20.Ten members of family VSM-20 displayed heterogeneous
	clinical phenotypes of isolated behavioural-variant FTD (bvFTD),
	ALS or a combination of the two. Parkinsonism was common, with one
	individual presenting with a corticobasal syndrome. Analysis of structural
	MRI scans from five affected family members revealed grey- and white-matter
	loss that was most prominent in the frontal lobes, with mild parietal
	and occipital lobe atrophy, but less temporal lobe atrophy than in
	10 severity-matched sporadic bvFTD cases. Autopsy in three family
	members showed a consistent and unique subtype of FTLD-TDP pathology.
	Genome-wide linkage analysis conclusively linked family VSM-20 to
	a 28.3 cM region between D9S1808 and D9S251 on chromosome 9p, reducing
	the published minimal linked region to a 3.7 Mb interval. Genomic
	sequencing and expression analysis failed to identify mutations in
	the 10 known and predicted genes within this candidate region, suggesting
	that next-generation sequencing may be needed to determine the mutational
	mechanism associated with chromosome 9p-linked FTD-ALS.Family VSM-20
	significantly reduces the region linked to FTD-ALS on chromosome
	9p. A distinct pattern of brain atrophy and neuropathological findings
	may help to identify other families with FTD-ALS caused by this genetic
	abnormality.},

	baseline scans, giving two measurements of atrophy that should be
	very similar, while scaled atrophy was established by reducing one
	of the same-day scans by a fixed amount, and rigidly registering
	this to the other same-day scan. Group separation was ascertained

	based on results from single cases ([3]: Breedin SD, Saffran EM,

	tasks to investigate the nature of the verbal and non-verbal comprehension
	deficit in 10 patients with semantic dementia. The patients were
	impaired on both verbal and non-verbal conditions of the assessments,
	and their accuracy on these tasks was directly related to their scores
	on a range of other tests requiring access to semantic memory. Further
	analyses revealed that performance was graded by concept and sound
	familiarity and, in addition, identified significant item consistency
	across the different conditions of the tasks. These results support
	the notion that the patients' deficits across all modalities were
	due to degradation within a single, central network of conceptual
	knowledge. There were also reliable differences between conditions.
	The sound-picture matching task proved to be more sensitive to semantic
	impairment than the word-picture matching equivalent, and the patients
	performed significantly better on the picture than word version of
	a semantic association test. We propose that these differences arise
	directly from the nature of the mapping between input modality and
	semantic memory. Words and sounds have an arbitrary relationship

	lobar degeneration (FTLD), including mutations within Granulin (GRN)
	genes. It was recently shown that FTLD patients carriers of GRN Thr272fs
	mutation [FTLD-GRN(m+)] exhibit more severe abnormalities, as assessed
	by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), than those with sporadic FTLD
	[FTLD-GRN(m-)]. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship
	between grey (GM) and white matter (WM) microstructural damage in
	FTLD patients, carriers, and non-carriers of the mutation. Twenty-three
	FTLD patients [6 GRN(m+) and 17 GRN(m-)] and 12 healthy subjects
	received an MRI scan including volumetric and diffusion imaging.
	GM was assessed using voxel-based morphometry, while the corpus callosum
	was reconstructed using diffusion tractography. Mean diffusivity
	and fractional anisotropy of the corpus callosum were compared between
	groups. FTLD patients showed widespread GM atrophy and altered diffusion
	indices in the corpus callosum when compared to healthy subjects.
	When contrasting GRN(m+) against GRN(m-) patients, the former group
	had more atrophy in the left frontal GM, and reduced fractional anisotropy
	and increased mean diffusivity in the left anterior part of the corpus
	callosum. Significant correlations between the GM and WM damage were
	found in GRN(m+) patients. This pattern of damage was able to predict
	some of the additional neuropsychological deficits observed in GRN(m+)
	as compared to GRN(m-) patients. A more prominent involvement of
	WM in GRN(m+) patients is consistent with the knowledge that GRN
	genes are expressed in the microglia. This involvement might be responsible
	for the accrual of additional GM atrophy via disconnection mechanisms.},

	We investigate the relationship between C9ORF72 expansions and the

	and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were performed on autopsy-confirmed
	ALS (N = 75), FTLD-TDP (N = 30), AD (N = 14), and controls (N = 11).
	IHC for neurodegenerative disease pathology consisted of C9ORF72,
	UBQLN, p62, and TDP-43. A C9ORF72 expansion was identified in 19.4
	\% of ALS and 31 \% of FTLD-TDP cases. ALS cases with C9ORF72 expansions
	frequently showed a bulbar onset of disease (57 \%) and more rapid
	disease progression to death compared to non-expansion cases. Staining
	with C9ORF72 antibodies did not yield specific pathology. UBQLN pathology
	showed a highly distinct pattern in ALS and FTLD-TDP cases with the
	C9ORF72 expansion, with UBQLN-positive cytoplasmic inclusions in
	the cerebellar granular layer and extensive UBQLN-positive aggregates
	and dystrophic neurites in the hippocampal molecular layer and CA
	regions. These UBQLN pathologies were sufficiently unique to allow
	correct prediction of cases that were later confirmed to have C9ORF72
	expansions by genetic analysis. UBQLN pathology partially co-localized
	with p62, and to a minor extent with TDP-43 positive dystrophic neurites
	and spinal cord skein-like inclusions. Our data indicate a pathophysiological
	link between C9ORF72 expansions and UBQLN proteins in ALS and FTLD-TDP
	that is associated with a highly characteristic pattern of UBQLN
	pathology. Our study indicates that this pathology is associated
	with alterations in clinical phenotype, and suggests that the presence

  abstract = {How the brain integrates signals from specific areas has been a longstanding
	critical question for neurobiologists. Two recent observations suggest
	a new approach to f{M}{R}{I} data analysis of this question. First,
	in many instances, the brain analyzes inputs by decomposing the information
	along several salient dimensions. For example, earlier work demonstrated
	that the brain splits a monetary gamble in terms of expected reward
	(ER) and variance of the reward (risk) [Preuschoff, K., Bossaerts,
	P., Quartz, S., 2006. Neural differentiation of expected reward and
	risk in human subcortical structures. Neuron 51, 381-390]. However,
	since ER and risk activate separate brain regions, the brain needs
	to integrate these activations to obtain an overall evaluation of
	the gamble. Second, recent evidence suggests that the correlation
	of the activity between neurons may serve a specific organizational
	purpose [Romo, R., Hernandez, A., Zainos, A., Salinas, E., 2003.
	Correlated neuronal discharges that increase coding efficiency during
	perceptual discrimination. Neuron 38, 649-657; Salinas, E., Sejnowski,
	T.J., 2001. Correlated neuronal activity and the flow of neural information.
	Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2, 539]. Specifically, it is hypothesized that
	correlations allow brain regions to integrate several signals in
	a way that minimizes noise. Under this hypothesis, we show here that
	canonical correlation analysis of f{M}{R}{I} data identifies how
	the signals from several regions are combined. A general linear model
	then verifies whether the identified combination indeed activates
	a projection area in the brain. We illustrate the proposed procedure
	on data recorded while human subjects played a simple card game.
	We show that the brain adds the signals of ER and risk to form a
	measure that activates the medial prefrontal cortex, consistent with
	the role of this brain structure in the evaluation of monetary gambles.},

	patients with AD, even during the preclinical stages. However, previous
	studies on longitudinal changes of tau and Abeta42 in individual
	patients with AD and elderly controls report somewhat inconsistent
	results. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We investigated the levels
	of tau and Abeta42 at baseline and after 1 year in 100 patients with
	AD. In a second cohort of 45 AD patients we measured the {C}{S}{F}
	biomarkers at baseline and after 2 years. Moreover, in 34 healthy
	elderly controls the {C}{S}{F} biomarkers were followed for 4 years.
	The baseline levels of tau were increased with >60\% in AD patients
	compared to controls (p<0.001), while baseline Abeta42 levels were
	decreased with >50\% (p<0.001). In the AD group followed for 2 years,
	tau increased with 16\% compared to the baseline levels (p<0.05).
	However, the levels of tau were stable over 4 years in the controls.
	The levels of Abeta42 did not change significantly over time in any
	of the groups. In the patients with AD, tau was moderately associated
	with worse cognitive performance already at baseline (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE:
	Tau and Abeta42 in {C}{S}{F} seem to reflect the underlying disease
	state in both early and late stages of AD. The slight increase in
	tau over time observed in the patients with AD is modest when compared
	to the relatively large difference in absolute tau levels between
	AD patients and controls. Therefore, these markers maintain their
	usefulness as state markers over time and might serve as surrogate
	markers for treatment efficacy in clinical trials.},

	diseases, such as frontotemporal lobar degeneration and amyotrophic
	lateral sclerosis. TDP-43 is a ubiquitous protein whose specific
	functions are probably crucial to establishing its pathogenic role.
	Apart from its involvement in transcription, splicing and mRNA stability,
	TDP-43 has also been described as a Drosha-associated protein. However,

	pathway is limited to the association mentioned above. Here we report
	for the first time which changes occur in the total miRNA population
	following TDP-43 knockdown in culture cells. In particular, we have
	observed that let-7b and miR-663 expression levels are down- and
	upregulated, respectively. Interestingly, both miRNAs are capable
	of binding directly to TDP-43 in different positions: within the
	miRNA sequence itself (let-7b) or in the hairpin precursor (miR-663).
	Using microarray data and real-time PCR we have also identified several
	candidate transcripts whose expression levels are selectively affected
	by these TDP-43-miRNA interactions.},

	in a proportion of patients with frontotemporal dementia, but the

	in patients with frontotemporal dementia has not been determined.
	Neurophysiological biomarkers have been developed to document motor
	system dysfunction including: short-interval intracortical inhibition,
	a marker of corticospinal motor neuron dysfunction and the neurophysiological
	index, a marker of lower motor neuron dysfunction. The present study
	performed detailed clinical and neurophysiological assessments on
	108 participants including 40 consecutive patients with frontotemporal
	dementia, 42 age- and gender-matched patients with motor neuron disease
	and 26 control subjects. Of the 40 patients with frontotemporal dementia,
	12.5\% had concomitant motor neuron disease. A further 27.3\% of
	the patients with frontotemporal dementia had clinical evidence of
	minor motor system dysfunction such as occasional fasciculations,
	mild wasting or weakness. Biomarkers of motor system function were
	abnormal in frontotemporal dementia. Average short-interval intracortical
	inhibition was reduced in frontotemporal dementia (4.3?±?1.7\%) compared
	with controls (9.1?±?1.1\%, P?<?0.05). Short-interval intracortical
	inhibition was particularly reduced in the progressive non-fluent

	dysfunction, although remained relatively preserved when compared
	with motor neuron disease (0.7, P?<?0.05). Motor system dysfunction

	and provide criteria for the pathological diagnosis in the neurodegenerative
	diseases grouped as frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD); revised
	criteria are proposed. Recent advances in molecular genetics, biochemistry,
	and neuropathology of FTLD prompted the Midwest Consortium for Frontotemporal
	Lobar Degeneration and experts at other centers to review and revise
	the existing neuropathologic diagnostic criteria for FTLD. The proposed
	criteria for FTLD are based on existing criteria, which include the
	tauopathies [FTLD with Pick bodies, corticobasal degeneration, progressive
	supranuclear palsy, sporadic multiple system tauopathy with dementia,
	argyrophilic grain disease, neurofibrillary tangle dementia, and
	FTD with microtubule-associated tau (MAPT) gene mutation, also called
	FTD with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17)]. The proposed
	criteria take into account new disease entities and include the novel
	molecular pathology, TDP-43 proteinopathy, now recognized to be the
	most frequent histological finding in FTLD. TDP-43 is a major component
	of the pathologic inclusions of most sporadic and familial cases
	of FTLD with ubiquitin-positive, tau-negative inclusions (FTLD-U)
	with or without motor neuron disease (MND). Molecular genetic studies
	of familial cases of FTLD-U have shown that mutations in the progranulin
	(PGRN) gene are a major genetic cause of FTLD-U. Mutations in valosin-containing
	protein (VCP) gene are present in rare familial forms of FTD, and
	some families with FTD and/or MND have been linked to chromosome
	9p, and both are types of FTLD-U. Thus, familial TDP-43 proteinopathy
	is associated with defects in multiple genes, and molecular genetics
	is required in these cases to correctly identify the causative gene
	defect. In addition to genetic heterogeneity amongst the TDP-43 proteinopathies,
	there is also neuropathologic heterogeneity and there is a close
	relationship between genotype and FTLD-U subtype. In addition to
	these recent significant advances in the neuropathology of FTLD-U,
	novel FTLD entities have been further characterized, including neuronal
	intermediate filament inclusion disease. The proposed criteria incorporate
	up-to-date neuropathology of FTLD in the light of recent immunohistochemical,
	biochemical, and genetic advances. These criteria will be of value
	to the practicing neuropathologist and provide a foundation for clinical,
	clinico-pathologic, mechanistic studies and in vivo models of pathogenesis
	of FTLD.},

	f ? {CN} and a randomly chosen set of frequencies Ω. It is possible
	to reconstruct f from the partial knowledge of its Fourier coefficients
	on the set Ω? A typical result of this paper is as follows. Suppose
	that f is a superposition of T spikes f(t) = {∑??T} f(?)?(t-?) obeying
	T ≤ {CM} · (log N)-1 · Ω for some constant {CM} \&gt; 0. We do not
	know the locations of the spikes nor their amplitudes. Then with

	, s.t.?(?) = f?(?) for all ? ? Ω. In short, exact recovery may be
	obtained by solving a convex optimization problem. We give numerical
	values for {CM} which depend on the desired probability of success.
	Our result may be interpreted as a novel kind of nonlinear sampling
	theorem. In effect, it says that any signal made out of T spikes
	may be recovered by convex programming from almost every set of frequencies
	of size O( T · log N). Moreover, this is nearly optimal in the sense
	that any method succeeding with probability 1 - {O(N-M)} would in
	general require a number of frequency samples at least proportional
	to T · log N. The methodology extends to a variety of other situations
	and higher dimensions. For example, we show how one can reconstruct
	a piecewise constant (one- or two-dimensional) object from incomplete
	frequency samples - provided that the number of jumps (discontinuities)
	obeys the condition above - by minimizing other convex functionals

  journal = {BMC Bioinformatics},
  year = {2009},
  volume = {10},
  pages = {34},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the context of systems biology, few sparse approaches
	have been proposed so far to integrate several data sets. It is however
	an important and fundamental issue that will be widely encountered
	in post genomic studies, when simultaneously analyzing transcriptomics,
	proteomics and metabolomics data using different platforms, so as
	to understand the mutual interactions between the different data
	sets. In this high dimensional setting, variable selection is crucial
	to give interpretable results. We focus on a sparse Partial Least
	Squares approach (sPLS) to handle two-block data sets, where the
	relationship between the two types of variables is known to be symmetric.
	Sparse PLS has been developed either for a regression or a canonical
	correlation framework and includes a built-in procedure to select
	variables while integrating data. To illustrate the canonical mode
	approach, we analyzed the NCI60 data sets, where two different platforms
	(cDNA and Affymetrix chips) were used to study the transcriptome
	of sixty cancer cell lines. RESULTS: We compare the results obtained
	with two other sparse or related canonical correlation approaches:
	CCA with Elastic Net penalization (CCA-EN) and Co-Inertia Analysis
	(CIA). The latter does not include a built-in procedure for variable
	selection and requires a two-step analysis. We stress the lack of
	statistical criteria to evaluate canonical correlation methods, which
	makes biological interpretation absolutely necessary to compare the
	different gene selections. We also propose comprehensive graphical
	representations of both samples and variables to facilitate the interpretation
	of the results. CONCLUSION: sPLS and CCA-EN selected highly relevant
	genes and complementary findings from the two data sets, which enabled
	a detailed understanding of the molecular characteristics of several
	groups of cell lines. These two approaches were found to bring similar
	results, although they highlighted the same phenomenons with a different
	priority. They outperformed CIA that tended to select redundant information.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: Episodic memory impairment is known to be the core
	of {A}lzheimer's disease (AD) dementia syndrome and one of the earliest
	domains to decline. However, episodic memory tests are long and expensive.
	METHODS: In a sample of the French Three-City Study (n = 1,516),
	we aimed at validating a subtest of the Mini-Mental State Examination
	({M}{M}{S}{E}) specifically measuring episodic memory. We focused
	on the correlation between 7 {M}{M}{S}{E} subscores and 4 scores
	of the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test (FCSRT) evaluating
	episodic memory. We performed linear regressions and principal component
	analyses to identify which {M}{M}{S}{E} subscores were better correlated
	with the FCSRT scores. Thereafter, we conducted validation analyses
	on the whole sample (n = 9,077). RESULTS: We found that subscores
	for orientation to time and the 3-word recall task were well correlated
	with FCSRT scores. The summation of these 2 subscores was more strongly
	associated with dementia and AD than the FCSRT scores and the total
	{M}{M}{S}{E} score. CONCLUSION: Orientation to time and the 3-word
	recall task might provide a good measure of episodic memory. Making
	the evaluation of episodic memory faster and cheaper, this finding
	can be of direct interest for practitioners and epidemiologists.},

	of hippocampal, entorhinal cortex (ERC), and whole brain longitudinal
	change in cognitively normal elderly controls (C), non-demented subjects
	with cognitive impairment (CI), and demented (D) subjects. METHODS:
	16 C, 6 CI, and 7 D subjects of comparable age were studied with
	{M}{R}{I} twice, at least 1 year apart. Longitudinal change in total
	brain size was measured by several methods, including computerized
	segmentation, non-linear warping, and change in the fluid/tissue
	boundaries between cerebrospinal fluid ({C}{S}{F}) and brain. Change
	in hippocampal volume was measured by semi-automated methods, and
	ERC volumes were manually measured. RESULTS: The annual rate of atrophy
	was greater in D versus C and D versus CI for cortical gray matter
	(cGM) (P=0.009 and 0.002), hippocampus (P=0.0001 and 0.002), and
	for the change in the fluid/tissue boundary (P=0.03 and 0.03). The
	annual rate of atrophy of ERC was greater in both CI and D versus
	C (P=0.01 and 0.0002). No significant differences between groups
	were found using non-linear warping. CONCLUSIONS: In CI, the greatest
	annual rates of atrophy were in ERC, while in D the greatest annual
	rates of atrophy were in hippocampus and cortex. Progressive ERC
	atrophy was observed with a greater degree of cognitive impairment,
	while hippocampal and cortical atrophy were only observed in demented
	subjects.},

	Interestingly, the failure of deactivation in these regions was also

  abstract = {Serial registered MRI provides a reproducible technique for detecting
	progressive cerebral atrophy in vivo and was used to determine if
	there were differences between the rates of cerebral atrophy in AD
	and frontotemporal dementia (FTD).Eighty-four patients with dementia
	(54 AD and 30 FTD) and 27 age-matched control subjects each had at
	least two volumetric MR scans. Serial scans were positionally matched
	(registered), and brain volume loss was determined by calculation
	of the brain boundary shift integral.There was a difference between
	the rates of whole-brain atrophy in patients (mean annual volume
	loss 2.7\% of total brain volume) and in control subjects (mean annual
	volume loss 0.5\%). AD and FTD were associated with different rates
	of atrophy (mean annual losses 2.4 and 3.2\%). The range of atrophy
	rates in the FTD group (0.3 to 8.0\%) greatly exceeded that in the
	AD group (0.5 to 4.7\%). Frontal-variant FTD was associated with
	a wider range of atrophy rates than temporal-variant FTD. Analysis
	of regional brain atrophy rates revealed that there was widespread
	symmetrically distributed cerebral volume loss in AD, whereas in
	frontal FTD there was greater atrophy anteriorly and in temporal
	FTD the atrophy rate was greatest in the left anterior cerebral cortex.Both
	AD and FTD patients had increased rates of brain atrophy. Whereas
	the patients with AD were associated with a relatively restricted
	spread of atrophy rates, the greater spread of rates observed in
	the patients with FTD may reflect the heterogeneity of disease in
	FTD, with differences observed between frontal and temporal FTD.
	Increased rates of whole-brain atrophy did not discriminate AD from
	FTD, but analysis of regional atrophy rates revealed marked differences
	between patient groups.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Structural magnetic resonance imaging ({M}{R}{I}) has
	been used to investigate the in vivo pathology of frontotemporal
	lobar degeneration. However, few neuroimaging studies have focused
	on white matter (WM) alterations in this disease. OBJECTIVES: To
	use volumetric {M}{R}{I} techniques to identify the patterns of WM
	atrophy in vivo in 2 clinical variants of frontotemporal lobar degeneration-frontotemporal
	dementia (FTD) and semantic dementia-and to compare the patterns
	of WM atrophy with those of gray matter (GM) atrophy in these diseases.
	DESIGN: Structural {M}{R}{I}s were obtained from patients with FTD
	(n = 12) and semantic dementia (n = 13) and in cognitively healthy
	age-matched controls (n = 24). Regional GM and WM were classified
	automatically from high-resolution T1-, T2-, and proton density-weighted
	{M}{R}{I}s with Expectation-Maximization Segmentation and compared
	between the groups using a multivariate analysis of covariance model
	that included age and WM lesion volumes as covariates. RESULTS: Patients
	with FTD had frontal WM atrophy and frontal, parietal, and temporal
	GM atrophy compared with controls, who had none. Patients with semantic
	dementia had temporal WM and GM atrophy and patients with FTD had
	frontal GM atrophy. Adding temporal WM volume to temporal GM volume
	significantly improved the discrimination between semantic dementia
	and FTD. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that patients with frontotemporal
	lobar degeneration who are in relatively early stages of the disease
	(Clinical Dementia Rating score, 1.0-1.2) have WM atrophy that largely
	parallels the pattern of GM atrophy typically associated with these
	disorders.},

	to characterize the linkage between the patterns of information from

	Our proposed method uses measurements from every brain voxel in each
	person's complementary co-registered images and uses the partial
	least square (PLS) algorithm to form a combined latent variable that
	maximizes the covariance among all of the combined variables. It
	represents a new way to calculate the singular value decomposition
	from the high-dimensional covariance matrix in a computationally
	feasible way. Analyzing fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography
	(PET) and volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images, this
	method distinguished 14 older adults from 15 younger adults (p=4e-12)
	with no overlap between groups, no need to correct for multiple comparisons,
	and greater power than the univariate Statistical Parametric Mapping
	(SPM), multimodal SPM or multivariate PLS analysis of either imaging
	modality alone. This technique has the potential to link patterns
	of information among any number of complementary images from an individual,
	to use other kinds of complementary complex datasets besides brain
	images, and to characterize individual state- or trait-dependent
	brain patterns in a more powerful way.},

	callosum. AD patients showed DTC in the corpus callosum, and in frontal

  abstract = {To assess the relative frequency of unique mutations and their associated
	characteristics in 97 individuals with mutations in progranulin (GRN),
	an important cause of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD).A
	46-site International Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration Collaboration
	was formed to collect cases of FTLD with TAR DNA-binding protein
	of 43-kDa (TDP-43)-positive inclusions (FTLD-TDP). We identified
	97 individuals with FTLD-TDP with pathogenic GRN mutations (GRN+
	FTLD-TDP), assessed their genetic and clinical characteristics, and
	compared them with 453 patients with FTLD-TDP in which GRN mutations
	were excluded (GRN- FTLD-TDP). No patients were known to be related.
	Neuropathologic characteristics were confirmed as FTLD-TDP in 79
	of the 97 GRN+ FTLD-TDP cases and all of the GRN- FTLD-TDP cases.Age
	at onset of FTLD was younger in patients with GRN+ FTLD-TDP vs GRN-
	FTLD-TDP (median, 58.0 vs 61.0 years; P < .001), as was age at death
	(median, 65.5 vs 69.0 years; P < .001). Concomitant motor neuron
	disease was much less common in GRN+ FTLD-TDP vs GRN- FTLD-TDP (5.4\%
	vs 26.3\%; P < .001). Fifty different GRN mutations were observed,
	including 2 novel mutations: c.139delG (p.D47TfsX7) and c.378C>A
	(p.C126X). The 2 most common GRN mutations were c.1477C>T (p.R493X,
	found in 18 patients, representing 18.6\% of GRN cases) and c.26C>A
	(p.A9D, found in 6 patients, representing 6.2\% of cases). Patients
	with the c.1477C>T mutation shared a haplotype on chromosome 17;
	clinically, they resembled patients with other GRN mutations. Patients
	with the c.26C>A mutation appeared to have a younger age at onset
	of FTLD and at death and more parkinsonian features than those with
	other GRN mutations.GRN+ FTLD-TDP differs in key features from GRN-
	FTLD-TDP.},

  abstract = {Patterns of brain atrophy measured by magnetic resonance structural
	imaging have been utilized as significant biomarkers for diagnosis
	of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, brain atrophy is variable across
	patients and is non-specific for AD in general. Thus, automatic methods
	for AD classification require a large number of structural data due
	to complex and variable patterns of brain atrophy. In this paper,
	we propose an incremental method for AD classification using cortical
	thickness data. We represent the cortical thickness data of a subject
	in terms of their spatial frequency components, employing the manifold
	harmonic transform. The basis functions for this transform are obtained
	from the eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator, which are
	dependent only on the geometry of a cortical surface but not on the
	cortical thickness defined on it. This facilitates individual subject
	classification based on incremental learning. In general, methods
	based on region-wise features poorly reflect the detailed spatial
	variation of cortical thickness, and those based on vertex-wise features
	are sensitive to noise. Adopting a vertex-wise cortical thickness
	representation, our method can still achieve robustness to noise
	by filtering out high frequency components of the cortical thickness
	data while reflecting their spatial variation. This compromise leads
	to high accuracy in AD classification. We utilized MR volumes provided
	by Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) to validate
	the performance of the method. Our method discriminated AD patients
	from Healthy Control (HC) subjects with 82\% sensitivity and 93\%
	specificity. It also discriminated Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)
	patients, who converted to AD within 18 months, from non-converted
	MCI subjects with 63\% sensitivity and 76\% specificity. Moreover,
	it showed that the entorhinal cortex was the most discriminative
	region for classification, which is consistent with previous pathological
	findings. In comparison with other classification methods, our method
	demonstrated high classification performance in both categories,
	which supports the discriminative power of our method in both AD
	diagnosis and AD prediction.},

  abstract = {The goal of probabilistic tractography is to obtain a connectivity
	index along a white matter pathway that reflects fibre organization
	and is sensitive to pathological abnormalities contributing to disability.
	Here, we present the development of voxel-based connectivity measures
	along the tractography-derived corticospinal tract {(CST).} We investigated
	whether these connectivity measures are different in patients with
	amyotrophic lateral sclerosis {(ALS)} and correlate with the rate
	of disease progression. We also investigated whether fractional anisotropy
	{(FA)}, which reflects directional coherence of fibre tracts, is
	reduced in the {CST} of {ALS} patients and relates to disease progression
	rate. Thirteen patients with probable or definite {ALS} and 19 healthy
	subjects were studied. The probabilistic tractography algorithm segmented
	the bilateral {CST}, along which {FA} and connectivity values were
	obtained. To take into account the asymmetric distribution of connectivity
	values, two summary statistic measures that focused on voxels with
	higher connectivity values were selected and then used in the analysis,
	together with the mean connectivity and the mean {FA.} To complete
	the analysis, the same summary measures for {FA} were included. Differences
	in all these indices between patients with moderate or rapid disease
	progression rate and controls were investigated using linear regression,
	adjusted for age and white matter fraction. The association between
	{FA} or connectivity in the {CST} and the disease progression rate
	was assessed using linear regression. Patients with a rapid disease
	progression rate had significantly lower summary connectivity measures
	than controls in the left {CST}, but there was only a borderline
	statistical difference in mean connectivity. Patients with rapid
	progression had a significantly lower mean {FA}, and any other {FA}
	measure, in both {CSTs} than controls. When only patients were considered,
	strong associations between the rate of disease progression and all
	the connectivity measures in the left {CST} were found {(P-values}
	between P {\textless} 0.001 and P = 0.002, partial correlation coefficients
	between ?0.90 and ?0.82). However, there was no evidence of an association
	between disease progression rate and any of the {FA} measures in
	the bilateral {CST.} Our findings suggest that {FA} and connectivity
	provide complementary information, since {FA} is sensitive to the
	detection of all the group differences, whereas the summary connectivity
	measures correlate with disease progression rate. The development
	of such connectivity measures raises their potential as markers of
	disease progression in {ALS}, and provides guidance for their use
	in other neurological diseases.},

	{(ADW)} magnetic resonance imaging for the integration of individual

	the operating room during microneurosurgery in the central region.
	We hypothesize that the three-dimensional (3-D) visualization of
	the pyramidal tract position {(PTV)} in a neuronavigation system
	based on {ADW} provides valid information concerning the position
	and extension of the principal motor pathways. {METHODS} A total
	of 13 consecutive patients with lesions adjacent to the pyramidal
	tracts and the central region underwent microneurosurgery with the
	help of pyramidal tract visualization {(PTV).} An {ADW} sequence
	obtained preoperatively was fused to an anatomic navigation sequence.
	The 3-D reconstructions of the precentral gyrus {(PG)}, the pyramidal
	tract, and the tumor were available in a customized neuronavigation
	system during surgery. Intraoperatively the {PG} was identified on
	the basis of the aforementioned data. Electric motorcortex stimulation
	{(CS)} was used to directly verify the {PG} location and indirectly
	the fiber tract position. {RESULTS} In 11 cases (92\%) the prediction
	of the principal motor pathways' position was correct. In one case
	of a meningioma, according to {PTV}, the tumor was falsely localized
	postcentrally. In the case of a precentral cavernoma, no motor response
	could be elicited by cortical stimulation. {CONCLUSION} Intraoperative
	{PTV} on the basis of {ADW} provides the neurosurgeon with reliable
	information concerning the position of the principal motor pathways
	during intracranial procedures as proved with intraoperative electrophysiological
	testing. The technique has the potential to reduce operative morbidity.
	{PTV} is straightforward and can be adapted to other customized neuronavigation
	devices.},

	of searching for a linear transformation that minimizes the statistical

	extension of the principal component analysis {(PCA)}, which can

	defines directions that are orthogonal. Potential applications of
	{ICA} include data analysis and compression, Bayesian detection,
	localization of sources, and blind identification and deconvolution.

  abstract = {Huntington's disease {(HD)} is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder
	that is currently untreatable. A prominent feature of {HD} pathology
	is the reduction of the pro-survival neurotrophin Brain-Derived Neurotrophic
	Factor {(BDNF).} Both {mRNA} and protein levels of {BDNF} are decreased
	in the brains of several {HD} rodent models and in human {HD} patients.
	We now report for the first time that this molecular event is mirrored
	in blood from {HD} rodent models. While protein levels of {BDNF}
	are undetectable in mouse blood, {mRNA} levels are measurable and
	diminish during {HD} progression in transgenic mouse {(R6/2)} and
	rat models of {HD.} Among the eight different {BDNF} transcripts,
	only {BDNF} exon {III} is transcribed in mouse blood and its expression
	is progressively compromised in R6/2 mice with respect to age-matched
	wild-types. Assessment of {BDNF} {mRNA} in {HD} rat blood shows a
	similar result, which is reinforced by evidence that protein levels
	of the neurotrophin are also significantly reduced at a symptomatic
	stage. Finally, we demonstrate that acute and chronic treatment of
	R6/2 mice with {CEP-1347}, a mixed lineage kinase {(MLK)} inhibitor
	with neuroprotective and neurotrophic effects, leads to increased
	total {BDNF} {mRNA} in blood when compared to untreated R6/2 mice.
	Our results indicate that alterations in {BDNF} {mRNA} levels in
	peripheral blood are a readily accessible measurement of disease
	progression and drug efficacy in {HD} rodent models.},

  abstract = {Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a common late-onset neurodegenerative
	disease, is associated with fronto-temporal dementia (FTD) in 3-10\%
	of patients. A mutation in CHMP2B was recently identified in a Danish
	pedigree with autosomal dominant FTD. Subsequently, two unrelated
	patients with familial ALS, one of whom also showed features of FTD,
	were shown to carry missense mutations in CHMP2B. The initial aim
	of this study was to determine whether mutations in CHMP2B contribute
	more broadly to ALS pathogenesis.Sequencing of CHMP2B in 433 ALS
	cases from the North of England identified 4 cases carrying 3 missense
	mutations, including one novel mutation, p.Thr104Asn, none of which
	were present in 500 neurologically normal controls. Analysis of clinical
	and neuropathological data of these 4 cases showed a phenotype consistent
	with the lower motor neuron predominant (progressive muscular atrophy
	(PMA)) variant of ALS. Only one had a recognised family history of
	ALS and none had clinically apparent dementia. Microarray analysis
	of motor neurons from CHMP2B cases, compared to controls, showed
	a distinct gene expression signature with significant differential
	expression predicting disassembly of cell structure; increased calcium
	concentration in the ER lumen; decrease in the availability of ATP;
	down-regulation of the classical and p38 MAPK signalling pathways,
	reduction in autophagy initiation and a global repression of translation.
	Transfection of mutant CHMP2B into HEK-293 and COS-7 cells resulted
	in the formation of large cytoplasmic vacuoles, aberrant lysosomal
	localisation demonstrated by CD63 staining and impairment of autophagy
	indicated by increased levels of LC3-II protein. These changes were
	absent in control cells transfected with wild-type CHMP2B.We conclude
	that in a population drawn from North of England pathogenic CHMP2B
	mutations are found in approximately 1\% of cases of ALS and 10\%
	of those with lower motor neuron predominant ALS. We provide a body
	of evidence indicating the likely pathogenicity of the reported gene
	alterations. However, absolute confirmation of pathogenicity requires
	further evidence, including documentation of familial transmission
	in ALS pedigrees which might be most fruitfully explored in cases
	with a LMN predominant phenotype.},

	to dementia. In the case of Alzheimer's disease (AD), synapse loss

	the past decade, strong evidence has emerged that oligomeric forms
	of amyloid beta, the protein that accumulates in senile plaques in
	the AD brain, contribute to degeneration of synaptic structure and
	function. More recent data indicate that pathological forms of tau

	also cause synaptic dysfunction and loss. In this review, we will
	present the case that soluble forms of both amyloid beta and tau
	protein act at the synapse to cause neural network dysfunction, and
	further that these two pathological proteins may act in concert to

	parkinsonism linked to mutations in MAPT (FTDP-17). Furthermore,
	in FTDU-17 patients, mutations in MAPT and genomic rearrangements
	in the MAPT region have been excluded by both genomic sequencing
	and fluorescence in situ hybridization on mechanically stretched
	chromosomes. Here we demonstrate that FTDU-17 is caused by mutations
	in the gene coding for progranulin (PGRN), a growth factor involved
	in multiple physiological and pathological processes including tumorigenesis.
	Besides the production of truncated PGRN proteins due to premature
	stop codons, we identified a mutation within the splice donor site
	of intron 0 (IVS0 + 5G > C), indicating loss of the mutant transcript
	by nuclear degradation. The finding was made within an extensively
	documented Belgian FTDU-17 founder family. Transcript and protein
	analyses confirmed the absence of the mutant allele and a reduction
	in the expression of PGRN. We also identified a mutation (c.3G >
	A) in the Met1 translation initiation codon, indicating loss of PGRN
	due to lack of translation of the mutant allele. Our data provide
	evidence that PGRN haploinsufficiency leads to neurodegeneration
	because of reduced PGRN-mediated neuronal survival. Furthermore,
	in a Belgian series of familial FTD patients, PGRN mutations were
	3.5 times more frequent than mutations in MAPT, underscoring a principal
	involvement of PGRN in FTD pathogenesis.},

  abstract = {Familial frontotemporal dementia (FTD), characterized by tau-negative,
	ubiquitin-positive inclusions at autopsy, is linked to a chromosomal
	region at 17q21 (FTDU-17), encompassing the gene encoding the microtubule
	associated protein tau, MAPT. Mutations in MAPT were previously identified
	in familial FTD with parkinsonism (FTDP-17); however, in FTDU-17
	patients, no pathogenic mutations were found in exonic regions consistent
	with the lack of tauopathy in FTDU-17 brains. Here, we excluded mutations
	in MAPT by genomic sequencing of 138.5 kb in FTDU-17 patients. Next,
	to facilitate the identification of the actual underlying genetic
	defect, we assembled the 6.5 Mb FTDU-17 sequence. Annotation demonstrated
	that MAPT is surrounded by three highly homologous low-copy repeats
	(LCRs) in a region of 1.7 Mb. Using evolutionary studies, short tandem
	repeat-based linkage disequilibrium (LD) and macro-restriction mapping,
	we demonstrated that these LCRs are at the basis of a series of rearrangements
	in the MAPT genomic region. One is an inversion that occurred 3 million
	years ago and resulted in a common polymorphism in humans to date.
	This inversion plus flanking LCRs spanned approximately 1.3 Mb and
	was shown to underlie the extended LD and haplotypes H1 and H2 across
	MAPT. However, in the FTDU-17 families, we ascertained segregation
	analysis precluding a relationship between the FTDU-17 and the H1/H2
	inversion. The presence of multiple homologous LCRs in the region
	predicts that other potentially more complex genomic rearrangements
	might be underlying FTDU-17.},

	the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease. The aim of the present study
	was to evaluate a magnetic resonance imaging-based automated classification
	schema for identifying {aMCI.} This was carried out in a sample of
	community-dwelling adults aged 70-90years old: 79 with a clinical
	diagnosis of {aMCI} and 204 who were cognitively normal. Our schema
	was novel in using measures of both spatial atrophy, derived from
	T1-weighted images, and white matter alterations, assessed with diffusion
	tensor imaging {(DTI)} tract-based spatial statistics {(TBSS).} Subcortical
	volumetric features were extracted using a {FreeSurfer-initialized}
	Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping {(FS+LDDMM)} segmentation
	approach, and fractional anisotropy {(FA)} values obtained for white
	matter regions of interest. Features were ranked by their ability
	to discriminate between {aMCI} and normal cognition, and a support
	vector machine {(SVM)} selected an optimal feature subset that was
	used to train {SVM} classifiers. As evaluated via 10-fold cross-validation,
	the classification performance characteristics achieved by our schema
	were: accuracy, 71.09\%; sensitivity, 51.96\%; specificity, 78.40\%;
	and area under the curve, 0.7003. Additionally, we identified numerous
	socio-demographic, lifestyle, health and other factors potentially
	implicated in the misclassification of individuals by our schema
	and those previously used by others. Given its high level of performance,

	(ISM), was identified immediately downstream of the ISS at I10 positions
	19-26. The ISM and ISS form a bipartite regulatory element, within
	which the ISM functions when the ISS is present, mitigating E10 repression
	by the ISS. Additionally, the 3' splice site of E10 is weak and requires

  abstract = {The hippocampal formation (HF) is a brain structure of great interest
	because of its central role in learning and memory, and its associated
	vulnerability to several neurological disorders. In vivo oblique
	coronal T2-weighted MRI with high in-plane resolution (~0.5 mm ?
	0.5 mm), thick slices (~2.0 mm), and a field of view tailored to
	imaging the hippocampal formation (denoted HF-MRI in this paper)
	has been advanced as a useful imaging modality for detailed hippocampal
	morphometry. Cross-sectional analysis of volume measurements derived
	from HF-MRI has shown the modality's promise to yield sensitive imaging-based
	biomarker for neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease.
	However, the utility of this modality for making measurements of
	longitudinal change has not yet been demonstrated. In this paper,
	using an unbiased deformation-based morphometry (DBM) pipeline, we
	examine the suitability of HF-MRI for estimating longitudinal change
	by comparing atrophy rates measured in the whole hippocampus from
	this modality with those measured from more common isotropic (~1
	mm?) T1-weighted MRI in the same set of individuals, in a cohort
	of healthy controls and patients with cognitive impairment. While
	measurements obtained from HF-MRI were largely consistent with those
	obtained from T1-MRI, HF-MRI yielded slightly larger group effect
	of greater atrophy rates in patients than in controls. The estimated
	minimum sample size required for detecting a 25\% change in patients'
	atrophy rate in the hippocampus compared to the control group with
	a statistical power ?=0.8 was N=269. For T1-MRI, the equivalent sample
	size was N=325. Using a dataset of test-retest scans, we show that
	the measurements were free of additive bias. We also demonstrate
	that these results were not a confound of certain methodological
	choices made in the DBM pipeline to address the challenges of making
	longitudinal measurements from HF-MRI, using a region of interest
	(ROI) around the HF to globally align serial images, followed by
	slice-by-slice deformable registration to measure local volume change.
	Additionally, we present a preliminary study of atrophy rate measurements
	within hippocampal subfields using HF-MRI. Cross-sectional differences
	in atrophy rates were detected in several subfields.},

  abstract = {Mild traumatic brain injury {(mTBI)} due to explosive blast is common
	among military service members and often associated with long term
	psychological and cognitive disruptions. Little is known about the
	neurological effects of blast-related {mTBI} and whether they differ
	from those of civilian, non-blast {mTBI.} Given that brain damage
	from blasts may be diffuse and heterogeneous, we tested the hypothesis
	that blast {mTBI} is associated with subtle white matter disruptions
	in the brain that are spatially inconsistent across individuals.
	We used diffusion tensor imaging to examine white matter integrity,
	as quantified by fractional anisotropy {(FA)}, in a group of American
	military service members with (n=25) or without (n=33) blast-related
	{mTBI} who had been deployed as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom or
	Operation Enduring Freedom. History of civilian non-blast {mTBI}
	was equally common across groups, which enabled testing of both blast
	and non-blast {mTBI} effects on measures sensitive to (1) concentrated,
	spatially consistent (average {FA} within a region of interest {[ROI])},
	(2) concentrated, spatially variable (number of {ROIs} with low average
	{FA)}, and (3) diffuse (number of voxels with low {FA)} disruptions
	of white matter integrity. Blast {mTBI} was associated with a diffuse,
	global pattern of lower white matter integrity, and this pattern
	was not affected by previous civilian {mTBI.} Neither type of {mTBI}
	had an effect on the measures sensitive to more concentrated and
	spatially consistent white matter disruptions. Additionally, individuals
	with more than one blast {mTBI} tended to have a larger number of
	low {FA} voxels than individuals with a single blast injury. These
	results indicate that blast {mTBI} is associated with disrupted integrity
	of several white matter tracts, and that these disruptions are diluted
	by averaging across the large number of voxels within an {ROI.} The
	reported pattern of effects supports the conclusion that the neurological
	effects of blast {mTBI} are diffuse, widespread, and spatially variable.},

	Clinic records and diagnostic histopathology were available for all

	histopathology/immunohistochemistry data were analysed where possible.
	The pathological diagnosis in a clear majority of cases was frontotemporal
	degeneration with ubiquitin inclusions (n = 13). Eleven of these
	cases had characteristic motor neuron disease-type inclusions in
	the dentate gyrus and cerebral cortex. Ubiquitin inclusions were
	found only in the inferior olivary nucleus in the other two, one
	of which was the only case to show degeneration of motor tracts and
	also to have shown evidence of motor neuron disease during life.
	None of the patients had motor symptoms or signs at presentation.
	A family history of motor neuron disease was documented in one case.
	Pick body-positive Pick's disease appeared three times. Two cases
	had {A}lzheimer's disease and significant coincidental {A}lzheimer-type
	pathology was also found in one of the ubiquitin inclusion cases.
	One of the {A}lzheimer's disease patients had changes in white matter
	signal on scanning, whereas all other scans showed cerebral atrophy
	only. Semi-quantitative assessment of regional neuronal loss found
	that anterior and inferior temporal regions bore the brunt of disease

  abstract = {Medial temporal lobe and temporoparietal brain regions are among
	the earliest neocortical sites to undergo pathophysiologic alterations
	in Alzheimer's disease (AD), although the underlying white matter
	changes in these regions is less well known. We employed diffusion
	tensor imaging to evaluate early alterations in regional white matter
	integrity in participants diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment
	(MCI). The following regions of interests (ROIs) were examined: 1)
	anterior cingulum (AC); 2) posterior cingulum (PC); 3) genu of the
	corpus callosum; 4) splenium of the corpus callosum; and 5) as a
	control site for comparison, posterior limb of the internal capsule.
	Forty nondemented participants were divided into demographically-similar
	groups based on cognitive status (MCI: n = 20; normal control: n
	= 20), and fractional anisotropy (FA) estimates of each ROI were
	obtained. MCI participants showed greater posterior white matter
	(i.e., PC, splenium) but not anterior white matter (i.e., AC, genu)
	changes, after adjusting for age, stroke risk, and whole brain volume.
	FA differences of the posterior white matter were best accounted
	for by changes in radial but not axial diffusivity. PC FA was also
	significantly positively correlated with hippocampal volume as well
	as with performance on tests of verbal memory, whereas stroke risk
	was significantly correlated with genu FA and was unrelated to PC
	FA. When investigating subtypes of our MCI population, amnestic MCI
	participants showed lower PC white matter integrity relative to those
	with non-amnestic MCI. Findings implicate involvement of posterior
	microstructural white matter degeneration in the development of MCI-related
	cognitive changes and suggest that reduced FA of the PC may be a
	candidate neuroimaging marker of AD risk.},

  abstract = {The aim of this study was to determine the neuronal basis for memory
	impairment in {A}lzheimer's disease by taking advantage of the clinical
	and metabolic heterogeneity of this pathology. To this end, 19 patients
	satisfying the NINCDSADRDA criteria for probably {A}lzheimer's disease
	of mild-to-moderate severity underwent a detailed examination of
	the five memory systems according to Tulving's model, together with
	a PET measurement of resting regional cerebral glucose utilization
	(CMRGlc). Compared with controls, the patients as a group showed
	the expected memory and metabolic profiles of impairment. Correlations
	(corrected for the effects of ageing) were calculated between memory
	scores and CMRGlc (normalized by the vermis CMRGlc) using two methods:
	(i) the classic regions-of-interest method, based on a priori hypotheses
	and individual coregistered structural {M}{R}{I}; and (ii) the statistical
	parametric mapping method which allows a systematic voxel-by-voxel
	analysis, in a more descriptive and exploratory way. Significant
	correlations were above chance levels and largely consistent between
	the two methods. They were almost exclusively positive (i.e. in the
	neurobiologically expected direction) and their distribution showed
	striking differences according to each memory system. Thus, verbal
	episodic memory impairment was related to changes in a large neuronal
	network including not only the limbic structures (mesial temporal
	cortex, thalamus and cingulate gyrus, with left side predominance)
	but also the parietotemporal and frontal association cortices of
	the right hemisphere, possibly on a compensatory basis. Regardless
	of modality, short-term memory tests were mainly correlated with
	bilateral activity in posterior association cortex, and also with
	activity in left prefrontal cortex for the visuospatial span, possibly
	indicating essentially uniform strategies for the performance of
	the different tasks. As predicted, semantic memory scores correlated
	with activity in temporoparietal and frontal association cortices
	of the left hemisphere, and also with activity in left cingulate
	cortex. Thus, for episodic, short-term and semantic memory, many
	findings fit classical neuropsychology, while most of the less expected
	ones were consistent with recent results from functional neuro-imaging
	in healthy subjects, notably with the hemispheric encoding/ retrieval
	asymmetry (HERA) model; only few findings suggested possible reorganization
	processes and/or recourse to unexpected cognitive strategy. Finally,
	only negative correlations were found for perceptual priming and
	procedural memory; although they could arise by chance, some of these
	unexpected findings give rise to interesting hypotheses about the
	cognitive relationships between the most and least affected memory
	systems. This study documents the validity and usefulness of our
	approach in unravelling the neural substrates of cognitive impairment
	in brain pathology without focal tissue loss such as that seen in
	neurodegenerative diseases.},

  abstract = {Several methods are now available for measuring cerebral perfusion
	and related hemodynamic parameters using magnetic resonance imaging
	(MRI). One class of techniques utilizes electromagnetically labeled
	arterial blood water as a noninvasive diffusible tracer for blood
	flow measurements. The electromagnetically labeled tracer has a decay
	rate of T1, which is sufficiently long to allow perfusion of the
	tissue and microvasculature to be detected. Alternatively, electromagnetic
	arterial spin labeling (ASL) may be used to obtain qualitative perfusion
	contrast for detecting changes in blood flow, similar to the use
	of susceptibility contrast in blood oxygenation level dependent functional
	MRI (BOLD fMRI) to detect functional activation in the brain. The
	ability to obtain blood flow maps using a non-invasive and widely
	available modality such as MRI should greatly enhance the utility
	of blood flow measurement as a means of gaining further insight into
	the broad range of hemodynamically related physiology and pathophysiology.
	This article describes the biophysical considerations pertaining
	to the generation of quantitative blood flow maps using a particular
	form of ASL in which arterial blood water is continuously labeled,
	termed continuous arterial spin labeling (CASL). Technical advances
	permit multislice perfusion imaging using CASL with reduced sensitivity
	to motion and transit time effects. Interpretable cerebral perfusion
	images can now be reliably obtained in a variety of clinical settings
	including acute stroke, chronic cerebrovascular disease, degenerative
	diseases and epilepsy. Over the past several years, the technical
	and theoretical foundations of CASL perfusion MRI techniques have
	evolved from feasibility studies into practical usage. Currently
	existing methodologies are sufficient to make reliable and clinically
	relevant observations which complement structural assessment using
	MRI. Future technical improvements should further reduce the acquisition
	times for CASL perfusion MRI, while increasing the slice coverage,
	resolution and stability of the images. These techniques have a broad
	range of potential applications in clinical and basic research of

  abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}
	
	New preclinical Alzheimer disease {(AD)} diagnostic criteria have
	been developed using biomarkers in cognitively normal {(CN)} adults.
	We implemented these criteria using an {MRI} biomarker previously
	associated with {AD} dementia, testing the hypothesis that individuals
	at high risk for preclinical {AD} would be at elevated risk for cognitive
	decline.
	
	
	{METHODS}
	
	The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database was interrogated
	for {CN} individuals. {MRI} data were processed using a published
	set of a priori regions of interest to derive a single measure known
	as the {AD} signature {(ADsig).} Each individual was classified as
	{ADsig-low} (≥ 1 {SD} below the mean: high risk for preclinical {AD)},
	{ADsig-average} (within 1 {SD} of mean), or {ADsig-high} (≥ 1 {SD}
	above mean). A 3-year cognitive decline outcome was defined a priori
	using change in Clinical Dementia Rating sum of boxes and selected
	neuropsychological measures.
	
	
	{RESULTS}
	
	Individuals at high risk for preclinical {AD} were more likely to
	experience cognitive decline, which developed in 21\% compared with
	7\% of {ADsig-average} and 0\% of {ADsig-high} groups (p = 0.03).
	Logistic regression demonstrated that every 1 {SD} of cortical thinning
	was associated with a nearly tripled risk of cognitive decline (p
	= 0.02). Of those for whom baseline {CSF} data were available, 60\%
	of the high risk for preclinical {AD} group had {CSF} characteristics
	consistent with {AD} while 36\% of the {ADsig-average} and 19\% of
	the {ADsig-high} groups had such {CSF} characteristics (p = 0.1).
	
	
	{CONCLUSIONS}
	
	This approach to the detection of individuals at high risk for preclinical
	{AD-identified} in single {CN} individuals using this quantitative
	{ADsig} {MRI} biomarker-may provide investigators with a population
	enriched for {AD} pathobiology and with a relatively high likelihood
	of imminent cognitive decline consistent with prodromal {AD.}},

	to differentiate these conditions from normal aging, psychiatric
	disorders, and other dementias, but also to distinguish between them.
	For early diagnosis, information on the initial and presenting symptoms
	of the FTLD phenotypes is essential. In the present study caregivers
	of 78 patients with FTD, 20 patients with SD and 17 patients with
	PA were interviewed about initial symptoms. In patients with FTD,
	the most frequent initial symptoms were alterations of personality,
	followed by forgetfulness and word finding difficulty. Patients with
	SD presented with word finding difficulty and behavioral disturbances.
	Almost all patients with PA developed word finding difficulty as
	the first manifestation of their disorder. Diagnostic latency - the
	time from disease onset to diagnosis was 4.1 years in FTD, 4.2 years
	in SD and 3.1 years in PA. Caregivers, and in some cases also patients,
	should be educated about the likely course and mortality of FTLD.
	To obtain information about survival time and cause of death associated
	with FTLD we analyzed follow-up data on 106 patients of whom 25 had
	died. The median survival time from the occurrence of first symptoms
	was 14 years. Mortality risk was significantly higher in patients
	with an early disease onset. Causes of death were varied, but pneumonia

	in early {HD} and even in presymptomatic stages. Thus, changes of
	the corpus callosum {(CC)} may reflect various aspects of {HD} pathogenesis.
	We recruited 17 {HD} patients, 17 pre-{HD} subjects, and 34 healthy
	age-matched controls. Three-dimensional anatomical {MRI} and diffusion
	tensor images of the brain were acquired on a {3T} scanner. Combining
	region-of-interest analyses, voxel-based morphometry, and tract-based
	spatial statistics, we investigated callosal thickness, {WM} density,
	fractional anisotropy, and radial and axial diffusivities. Compared
	with controls, pre-{HD} subjects showed reductions of the isthmus,
	likely due to myelin damage. Compared with pre-{HD} subjects, {HD}
	patients showed reductions of isthmus and body, with axonal damage
	confined to the body. Compared with controls, {HD} patients had significantly
	decreased callosal measures in extended regions across almost the
	entire {CC.} At this disease stage, both myelin and axonal damage
	are detectable. Supplementary multiple regression analyses revealed
	that {WM} reduction density in the isthmus as well as Disease Burden
	scores allowed to predict the {"HD} development" index. While callosal
	changes seem to proceed in a posterior-to-anterior direction as the
	diseases progresses, this observation requires validation in future

  abstract = {{SUMMARY:} With ideal spatial adaptation, an oracle furnishes information
	about how best to adapt a spatially variable estimator, whether piecewise
	constant, piecewise polynomial, variable knot spline, or variable
	bandwidth kernel, to the unknown function. Estimation with the aid
	of an oracle offers dramatic advantages over traditional linear estimation
	by nonadaptive kernels; however, it is a priori unclear whether such
	performance can be obtained by a procedure relying on the data alone.
	We describe a new principle for spatially-adaptive estimation: selective
	wavelet reconstruction. We show that variable-knot spline fits and
	piecewise-polynomial fits, when equipped with an oracle to select
	the knots, are not dramatically more powerful than selective wavelet
	reconstruction with an oracle. We develop a practical spatially adaptive
	method, Risk Shrink, which works by shrinkage of empirical wavelet
	coefficients. {RiskShrink} mimics the performance of an oracle for
	selective wavelet reconstruction as well as it is possible to do
	so. A new inequality in multivariate normal decision theory which
	we call the oracle inequality shows that attained performance differs
	from ideal performance by at most a factor of approximately 2 log
	n, where n is the sample size. Moreover no estimator can give a better
	guarantee than this. Within the class of spatially adaptive procedures,
	{RiskShrink} is essentially optimal. Relying only on the data, it
	comes within a factor log 2n of the performance of piecewise polynomial
	and variableknot spline methods equipped with an oracle. In contrast,
	it is unknown how or if piecewise polynomial methods could be made
	to function this well when denied access to an oracle and forced
	to rely on data alone. © 1994 Biometrika Trust.},

	derives from a conceptual framework of local isometry in which the
	manifold M, viewed as a Riemannian submanifold of the ambient Euclidean
	space ?n, is locally isometric to an open, connected subset ? of
	Euclidean space ?d. Because ? does not have to be convex, this framework
	is able to handle a significantly wider class of situations than
	the original {ISOMAP} algorithm. The theoretical framework revolves
	around a quadratic form ?(f) = {∫M} {?Hf(m)?dm} defined on functions
	f : M ? ?. Here Hf denotes the Hessian of f, and ?(f) averages the
	Frobenius norm of the Hessian over M. To define the Hessian, we use
	orthogonal coordinates on the tangent planes of M. The key observation
	is that, if M truly is locally isometric to an open, connected subset
	of ?d, then ?(f) has a (d + 1)-dimensional null space consisting
	of the constant functions and a d-dimensional space of functions
	spanned by the original isometric coordinates. Hence, the isometric
	coordinates can be recovered up to a linear isometry. Our method
	may be viewed as a modification of locally linear embedding and our
	theoretical framework as a modification of the Laplacian eigenmaps
	framework, where we substitute a quadratic form based on the Hessian
	in place of one based on the Laplacian.},

	using advanced magnetic resonance imaging techniques such as diffusion
	tensor imaging and voxel-based morphometry have not been extensively

	was compared to healthy control subjects using a multi-modal neuroimaging
	approach comprising T(1)-weighted, diffusion-weighted and resting-state
	functional magnetic resonance imaging. Using probabilistic tractography,
	a grey matter connection network was defined based upon the prominent

	grey matter network as an input for a dual-regression analysis, was

	to differentiate clinically because of overlapping symptoms. Distinguishing
	the two dementias based on volumetric measurements of brain atrophy
	with {M}{R}{I} has been only partially successful. Whether {M}{R}{I}
	measurements of cortical thinning improve the differentiation between
	{A}lzheimer's disease and FTD is unclear. In this study, we measured
	cortical thickness using a set of automated tools (Freesurfer) to
	reconstruct the brain's cortical surface from T1-weighted structural
	{M}{R}{I} data in 22 patients with {A}lzheimer's disease, 19 patients
	with FTD and 23 cognitively normal subjects. The goals were to detect
	the characteristic patterns of cortical thinning in these two types
	of dementia, to test the relationship between cortical thickness
	and cognitive impairment, to determine if measurement of cortical
	thickness is better than that of cortical volume for differentiating
	between these dementias and normal ageing and improving the classification
	of {A}lzheimer's disease and FTD based on neuropsychological scores
	alone. Compared to cognitively normal subjects, {A}lzheimer's disease
	patients had a thinner cortex primarily in bilateral, frontal, parietal,
	temporal and occipital lobes (P < 0.001), while FTD patients had
	a thinner cortex in bilateral, frontal and temporal regions and some
	thinning in inferior parietal regions and the posterior cingulate
	(P < 0.001). Compared to FTD patients, {A}lzheimer's disease patients
	had a thinner cortex (P < 0.001) in parts of bilateral parietal and
	precuneus regions. Cognitive impairment was negatively correlated
	with cortical thickness of frontal, parietal and temporal lobes in
	{A}lzheimer's disease, while similar correlations were not significant
	in FTD. Measurement of cortical thickness was similar to that of
	cortical volume in differentiating between normal ageing, {A}lzheimer's
	disease and FTD. Furthermore, cortical thickness measurements significantly
	improved the classification between {A}lzheimer's disease and FTD
	based on neuropsychological scores alone, including the Mini-Mental
	State Examination and a modified version of the Trail-Making Test.
	In conclusion, the characteristic patterns of cortical thinning in
	{A}lzheimer's disease and FTD suggest that cortical thickness may
	be a useful surrogate marker for these types of dementia.},

	clear in relation to cell physiology and pathophysiology. The observation
	that mitochondria take up Ca2+ during physiological Ca2+ signalling
	in a variety of cell types leads to four questions: (i) {'What} is
	the impact of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake on mitochondrial function?'
	(ii) {'What} is the impact of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake on Ca2+ signalling?'
	(iii) {'What} are the consequences of impaired mitochondrial Ca2+
	uptake for cell function?' and finally (iv) {'What} are the consequences
	of pathological {[Ca2+]c} signalling for mitochondrial function?'
	These will be addressed in turn. Thus: (i) accumulation of Ca2+ into
	mitochondria regulates mitochondrial metabolism and causes a transient
	depolarisation of mitochondrial membrane potential. (ii) Mitochondria
	may act as a spatial Ca2+ buffer in many cells, regulating the local
	Ca2+ concentration in cellular microdomains. This process regulates
	processes dependent on local cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration {([Ca2+]c)},
	particularly the flux of Ca2+ through {IP3-gated} channels of the
	endoplasmic reticulum {(ER)} and the channels mediating capacitative
	Ca2+ influx through the plasma membrane. Consequently, mitochondrial
	Ca2+ uptake plays a substantial role in shaping {[Ca2+]c} signals
	in many cell types. (iii) Impaired mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake alters
	the spatiotemporal characteristics of cellular {[Ca2+]c} signalling
	and downregulates mitochondrial metabolism. (iv) Under pathological
	conditions of cellular {[Ca2+]c} overload, particularly in association
	with oxidative stress, mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake may trigger pathological
	states that lead to cell death. In the model of glutamate excitotoxicity,
	microdomains of {[Ca2+]c} are apparently central, as the pathway
	to cell death seems to require the local activation of neuronal nitric
	oxide synthase {(nNOS)}, itself held by scaffolding proteins in close
	association with the {NMDA} receptor. Mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in
	combination with {NO} production triggers the collapse of mitochondrial
	membrane potential, culminating in delayed cell death.},

  abstract = {Various biomarkers have been reported in recent literature regarding
	imaging abnormalities in different types of dementia. These biomarkers
	have helped to significantly improve early detection and also differentiation
	of various dementia syndromes. In this study, we systematically applied
	whole-brain and region-of-interest (ROI) based support vector machine
	classification separately and on combined information from different
	imaging modalities to improve the detection and differentiation of
	different types of dementia.Patients with clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's
	disease (AD: n?=?21), with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD:
	n?=?14) and control subjects (n?=?13) underwent both [F18]fluorodeoxyglucose
	positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scanning and magnetic resonance
	imaging (MRI), together with clinical and behavioral assessment.
	FDG-PET and MRI data were commonly processed to get a precise overlap
	of all regions in both modalities. Support vector machine classification
	was applied with varying parameters separately for both modalities
	and to combined information obtained from MR and FDG-PET images.
	ROIs were extracted from comprehensive systematic and quantitative
	meta-analyses investigating both disorders.Using single-modality
	whole-brain and ROI information FDG-PET provided highest accuracy
	rates for both, detection and differentiation of AD and FTLD compared
	to structural information from MRI. The ROI-based multimodal classification,
	combining FDG-PET and MRI information, was highly superior to the
	unimodal approach and to the whole-brain pattern classification.
	With this method, accuracy rate of up to 92\% for the differentiation
	of the three groups and an accuracy of 94\% for the differentiation
	of AD and FTLD patients was obtained.Accuracy rate obtained using
	combined information from both imaging modalities is the highest
	reported up to now for differentiation of both types of dementia.
	Our results indicate a substantial gain in accuracy using combined
	FDG-PET and MRI information and suggest the incorporation of such
	approaches to clinical diagnosis and to differential diagnostic procedures
	of neurodegenerative disorders.},

	Selection and Backward Elimination is to choose a linear model on
	the basis of the same set of data to which the model will be applied.
	Typically we have available a large collection of possible covariates
	from which we hope to select a parsimonious set for the efficient
	prediction of a response variable. Least Angle Regression {(LARS)},
	a new model selection algorithm, is a useful and less greedy version
	of traditional forward selection methods. Three main properties are
	derived: (1) A simple modification of the {LARS} algorithm implements
	the Lasso, an attractive version of ordinary least squares that constrains
	the sum of the absolute regression coefficients; the {LARS} modification
	calculates all possible Lasso estimates for a given problem, using
	an order of magnitude less computer time than previous methods. (2)
	A different {LARS} modification efficiently implements Forward Stagewise
	linear regression, another promising new model selection method;
	this connection explains the similar numerical results previously
	observed for the Lasso and Stagewise, and helps us understand the
	properties of both methods, which are seen as constrained versions
	of the simpler {LARS} algorithm. (3) A simple approximation for the
	degrees of freedom of a {LARS} estimate is available, from which
	we derive a C p estimate of prediction error; this allows a principled
	choice among the range of possible {LARS} estimates. {LARS} and its
	variants are computationally efficient: the paper describes a publicly
	available algorithm that requires only the same order of magnitude
	of computational effort as ordinary least squares applied to the

  abstract = {{ABSTRACT.} Molecular biologic techniques are currently considered
	as new diagnostic and prognostic parameters with a sensitivity and
	specificity exceeding those of histologic and functional data currently
	used in clinical practice. The results in various clinical settings
	have been of limited value up to now. This study is an investigation
	of the use of tissue levels of {RNA} determined in routine clinical
	kidney biopsies as prognostic tools. The focus was on {RNA} encoding
	for molecules known to be involved in the pathogenesis of renal disorders.
	Fresh kidney biopsy tissue was obtained from 52 patients with various
	renal diseases. The {GFR} was followed for 12 mo. The extent of glomerulosclerosis
	and interstitial fibrosis in the biopsies was determined with quantitative
	digital image analysis. Glomerular and tubulointerstitial compartments
	from each biopsy specimen were separated, and {mRNA} levels of {TGF-},
	collagen I, collagen {IV}, and fibronectin were quantitated by real-time
	{PCR.} Correlations, along with 95\% confidence intervals {(CI)},
	between all variables tested at time biopsy were determined. To assess
	their prognostic value, these variables were correlated with the
	slope of {GFR} within several time intervals after biopsy. In addition,
	to evaluate the predictive value of the variables for outcome in
	individual patients, differences for each variable were tested between
	patients showing progressive decline in renal function (slope {GFR}
	{\textless} 0) and patients showing stable or improving renal function
	over time (slope {GFR} ≥ 0). In chronic renal diseases, the extent
	of histologic damage correlated with the {GFR} at the time of biopsy
	(r = -0.44; {CI} -0.68 to -0.11), but it did not correlate with the
	slope expressing a change in {GFR} after the biopsy. Tubulointerstitial
	{TGF-} {mRNA} levels correlated with the rate of change in {GFR}
	between time of biopsy and 1 mo later (r = 0.41; {CI}, 0.07 to 0.67).
	The {GFR} at the time of biopsy correlated with the slope of change
	in {GFR} between time of biopsy and 12 mo later (r = -0.50; {CI},
	-0.73 to -0.18). In chronic renal diseases, glomerular fibronectin
	{mRNA} levels, in comparison with the {GFR} at time of biopsy, correlated
	relatively strongly with the slope of change in {GFR} between 3 and
	12 mo (r = 0.50; {CI}, 0.16 to 0.74). Patients with favorable renal
	outcome after 12 mo showed significantly higher {TGF-} {mRNA} levels
	and lower proteinuria levels at time of biopsy {(P} {\textless} 0.05)
	than patients with a progressive decline in renal function. This
	study shows that {mRNA} levels measured in kidney biopsies can function
	as prognostic tools in human renal diseases. In particular, relatively
	high levels of tubulointerstitial {TGF-} {mRNA} and glomerular fibronectin
	{mRNA} are associated with less deterioration in renal function.

  abstract = {Shrinkage is a well known and appealing denoising technique, introduced
	originally by Donoho and Johnstone in 1994. The use of shrinkage
	for denoising is known to be optimal for Gaussian white noise, provided
	that the sparsity on the signal's representation is enforced using
	a unitary transform. Still, shrinkage is also practiced with nonunitary,
	and even redundant representations, typically leading to very satisfactory
	results. In this correspondence we shed some light on this behavior.
	The main argument in this work is that such simple shrinkage could
	be interpreted as the first iteration of an algorithm that solves
	the basis pursuit denoising {(BPDN)} problem. While the desired solution
	of {BPDN} is hard to obtain in general, we develop a simple iterative
	procedure for the {BPDN} minimization that amounts to stepwise shrinkage.
	We demonstrate how the simple shrinkage emerges as the first iteration
	of this novel algorithm. Furthermore, we show how shrinkage can be
	iterated, turning into an effective algorithm that minimizes the
	{BPDN} via simple shrinkage steps, in order to further strengthen
	the denoising effect},

	The variability in brain morphology and the difference in intensity
	characteristics due to imaging sequences make the development of
	a general purpose brain extraction algorithm challenging. To address
	this issue, we propose a new robust method (BEaST) dedicated to produce
	consistent and accurate brain extraction. This method is based on
	nonlocal segmentation embedded in a multi-resolution framework. A
	library of 80 priors is semi-automatically constructed from the NIH-sponsored
	MRI study of normal brain development, the International Consortium
	for Brain Mapping, and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative
	databases. In testing, a mean Dice similarity coefficient of 0.9834±0.0053
	was obtained when performing leave-one-out cross validation selecting
	only 20 priors from the library. Validation using the online Segmentation
	Validation Engine resulted in a top ranking position with a mean
	Dice coefficient of 0.9781±0.0047. Robustness of BEaST is demonstrated
	on all baseline ADNI data, resulting in a very low failure rate.
	The segmentation accuracy of the method is better than two widely
	used publicly available methods and recent state-of-the-art hybrid
	approaches. BEaST provides results comparable to a recent label fusion
	approach, while being 40 times faster and requiring a much smaller
	library of priors.},

  abstract = {A multivariate classification approach has been presented to examine
	the brain abnormalities, i.e., due to prenatal cocaine exposure,
	using both structural and functional brain images. First, a regional
	statistical feature extraction scheme was adopted to capture discriminative
	features from voxel-wise morphometric and functional representations
	of brain images, in order to reduce the dimensionality of the features
	used for classification, as well as to achieve the robustness to
	registration error and inter-subject variations. Then, this feature
	extraction method was used in conjunction with a hybrid feature selection
	method and a nonlinear support vector machine for the classification
	of brain abnormalities. This brain classification approach has been
	applied to detecting the brain abnormality associated with prenatal
	cocaine exposure in adolescents. A promising classification performance
	was achieved on a data set of 49 subjects (24 normal and 25 prenatally
	cocaine-exposed teenagers), with a leave-one-out cross-validation.
	Experimental results demonstrated the efficacy of our method, as
	well as the importance of incorporating both structural and functional
	images for brain classification. Moreover, spatial patterns of group
	difference derived from the constructed classifier were mostly consistent
	with the results of the conventional statistical analysis method.
	Therefore, the proposed approach provided not only a multivariate
	classification method for detecting brain abnormalities, but also
	an alternative way for group analysis of multimodality images.},

	Converging evidence was obtained from functional neuroimaging in
	healthy young adults and from behavioral and structural magnetic
	resonance imaging (MRI) data in patients with focal neurodegenerative
	disease. In both studies, participants judged the order of consecutive
	event pairs taken from a script. Event pairs either were clustered

	script. Controls judged events more accurately and quickly if taken
	from the same cluster within a script compared with different clusters,
	even though all event pairs were consecutive, consistent with the
	hierarchical organization of a script. Functional magnetic resonance
	imaging associated this with bilateral inferior frontal activation.
	Patients with progressive nonfluent aphasia or behavior-variant frontotemporal
	dementia did not distinguish between event pairs from the same cluster
	or from different clusters within a script. Structural MRI associated
	this deficit with significant frontal cortical atrophy. Our findings

  abstract = {We studied the local viscoelasticity of the apical membrane of human
	umbilical vein endothelial cells within confluent layers by magnetic
	tweezers microrheometry. Magnetic beads are coupled to various integrins
	by coating with fibronectin or invasin. By analyzing the deflection
	of beads evoked by various force scenarios we demonstrate that the
	cell envelope behaves as a linear viscoelastic body if forces up
	to 2 {nN} are applied for short times ({\textless}20 s) but can respond
	in an adaptive way if stress pulses are applied longer ({\textgreater}30
	s). The time-dependent shear relaxation modulus G(t) exhibits three
	time regimes: a fast response (t {\textless} 0.05 s) where the relaxation
	modulus G(t) obeys a power law G(t) approximately t(-0.82+/-0.02);
	a plateau-like behavior (at 0.05 s {\textless} t {\textless} 0.15
	s); and a slow flow-like response which is, however, partially reversible.
	Strain field mapping experiments with colloidal probes show that
	local forces induce a strain field exhibiting a range of zeta = 10
	+/- 1 microm, but which could only be observed if nonmagnetic beads
	were coupled to the cell surface by invasin. By application of the
	theory of elasticity of planar bodies we estimated a surface shear
	modulus of 2.5 x10(-4) N/m. By assuming a thickness of the actin
	cortex of approximately 0.5 microm we estimate a Young modulus micro
	approximately 400 Pa for the apical membrane. The value agrees with
	a plateau modulus of an entangled or weakly cross-linked actin network
	of an actin concentration of 100 {microM} (mesh size 0.2 microm).
	This result together with our observation of a strong reduction of
	the shear modulus by the actin destabilizing agent latrunculin A
	suggests that the shear modulus measured by our technique is determined
	by the actin cortex. The effect of two ligands inducing actin stress
	fiber formation and centripetal contraction of cells (associated
	with the formation of gaps in the confluent cell monolayer) on the
	viscoelastic responses were studied: histamine and lysophosphatidic
	acid {(LPA).} Histamine evoked a dramatic increase of the cell stiffness
	by {\textgreater}1 order of magnitude within {\textless}30 s, which
	is attributed to a transient rise of the intracellular Ca(2+) level,
	since {DMSO} exerted a similar effect. The stiffening is accompanied
	by a concomitant rounding of the cells as observed by microinterferometry
	and relaxes partially in the timescale of 5 min, whereas gaps between
	cells close after approximately 30 min. {LPA} did not exert a remarkable
	and reproducible effect other than an occasional very weak transient
	increase of the shear stiffness, which shows that the gap formation
	activated by {LPA} is mediated by a different mechanism than that
	induced by histamine.},

	associated with GRN mutations is heterogeneous and may include clinical

	cause disease through a uniform disease mechanism, i.e. the loss
	of functional GRN or haploinsufficiency. To determine if expression
	of GRN in plasma could predict GRN mutation status and could be used
	as a biological marker, we optimized a GRN ELISA and studied plasma
	samples of a consecutive clinical FTLD series of 219 patients, 70
	control individuals, 72 early-onset probable Alzheimer's disease
	patients and nine symptomatic and 18 asymptomatic relatives of GRN
	mutation families. All FTLD patients with GRN loss-of-function mutations
	showed significantly reduced levels of GRN in plasma to about one
	third of the levels observed in non-GRN carriers and control individuals
	(P < 0.001). No overlap in distributions of GRN levels was observed
	between the eight GRN loss-of-function mutation carriers (range:
	53-94 ng/ml) and 191 non-GRN mutation carriers (range: 115-386 ng/ml).
	Similar low levels of GRN were identified in asymptomatic GRN mutation
	carriers. Importantly, ELISA analyses also identified one probable
	Alzheimer's disease patient (1.4\%) carrying a loss-of-function mutation
	in GRN. Biochemical analyses further showed that the GRN ELISA only
	detects full-length GRN, no intermediate granulin fragments. This
	study demonstrates that using a GRN ELISA in plasma, pathogenic GRN
	mutations can be accurately detected in symptomatic and asymptomatic
	carriers. The approximately 75\% reduction in full-length GRN, suggests
	an unbalanced GRN metabolism in loss-of-function mutation carriers
	whereby more GRN is processed into granulins. We propose that plasma
	GRN levels could be used as a reliable and inexpensive tool to identify
	all GRN mutation carriers in early-onset dementia populations and
	asymptomatic at-risk individuals.},

	methods for estimating cortical thickness from neuroimaging data
	are labor intensive, requiring several days of effort by a trained

	problematic for manual techniques, frequently resulting in measurement
	errors in regions in which the cortical surface is not perpendicular
	to any of the cardinal axes. As a consequence, it has been impractical
	to obtain accurate thickness estimates for the entire cortex in individual

	Here, we present an automated method for accurately measuring the
	thickness of the cerebral cortex across the entire brain and for
	generating cross-subject statistics in a coordinate system based
	on cortical anatomy. The intersubject standard deviation of the thickness
	measures is shown to be less than 0.5 mm, implying the ability to
	detect focal atrophy in small populations or even individual subjects.

  abstract = {Highly accurate surface models of the cerebral cortex are becoming
	increasingly important as tools in the investigation of the functional
	organization of the human brain. The construction of such models
	is difficult using current neuroimaging technology due to the high
	degree of cortical folding. Even single voxel misclassifications
	can result in erroneous connections being created between adjacent
	banks of a sulcus, resulting in a topologically inaccurate model.
	These topological defects cause the cortical model to no longer be
	homeomorphic to a sheet, preventing the accurate inflation, flattening,
	or spherical morphing of the reconstructed cortex. Surface deformation
	techniques can guarantee the topological correctness of a model,
	but are time-consuming and may result in geometrically inaccurate
	models. In order to address this need we have developed a technique
	for taking a model of the cortex, detecting and fixing the topological
	defects while leaving that majority of the model intact, resulting
	in a surface that is both geometrically accurate and topologically
	correct.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is characterized
	by impairments in social, behavioral, and/or language function, but
	postmortem studies indicate that multiple neuropathological entities
	lead to FTLD. This study assessed whether specific clinical features
	predict the underlying pathology. METHODS: A clinicopathological
	correlation was performed on 90 consecutive patients with a pathological
	diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia and was compared with an additional
	24 cases accrued during the same time period with a clinical diagnosis
	of FTLD, but with pathology not typically associated with frontotemporal
	dementia. RESULTS: Postmortem examination showed multiple pathologies
	including tauopathies (46\%), FTLD with ubiquitin-positive inclusions
	(29\%), and {A}lzheimer's disease (17\%). The pathological groups
	manifested some distinct demographic, clinical, and neuropsychological
	features, although these attributes showed only a statistical association
	with the underlying pathology. FTLD with ubiquitin-positive inclusions
	was more likely to present with both social and language dysfunction,
	and motor neuron disease was more likely to emerge in these patients.
	Tauopathies were more commonly associated with an extrapyramidal
	disorder. {A}lzheimer's disease was associated with relatively greater
	deficits in memory and executive function. INTERPRETATION: Clinical
	and neuropsychological features contribute to delineating the spectrum
	of pathology underlying a patient diagnosed with FTLD, but biomarkers
	are needed that, together with the clinical phenotype, can predict
	the underlying neuropathology.},

	disease of bone (IBMPFD) is a rare, autosomal-dominant disorder caused

	there is limited information on the neuropathology in IBMPFD. We
	performed a detailed, systematic analysis of the neuropathologic
	changes in 8 patients with VCP mutations. A novel pattern of ubiquitin
	pathology was identified in IBMPFD that was distinct from sporadic
	and familial FTLD-U without VCP gene mutations. This was characterized
	by ubiquitin-positive neuronal intranuclear inclusions and dystrophic
	neurites. In contrast to FTLD-U, only rare intracytoplasmic inclusions
	were identified. The ubiquitin pathology was abundant in the neocortex,
	less robust in limbic and subcortical nuclei, and absent in the dentate
	gyrus. Only rare inclusions were detected with antibodies to VCP
	and there was no biochemical alteration in the VCP protein. VCP is
	associated with a variety of cellular activities, including regulation
	of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Our findings are consistent with
	the hypothesis that the pathology associated with VCP gene mutations
	is the result of impairment of ubiquitin-based degradation pathways.},

  abstract = {Corticobasal degeneration (CBD) is an adult-onset progressive neurodegenerative
	disorder characterized by L-dopa-resistant rigidity, focal cortical

	CBD is the deposition of filamentous inclusions in neurons and glia
	composed of hyperphosphorylated tau with only four microtubule-binding
	repeats (4R-tau). To characterize the regional burden of tau pathology
	in CBD, we studied 12 brains with the neuropathological diagnosis
	of CBD using biochemical and histochemical techniques. Eleven brain
	regions were evaluated including gray and white matter from frontal,
	parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes and cerebellum as well as
	basal ganglia. Although the distribution of tau pathology was variable,
	neuropathological and biochemical data showed a similar burden of
	tau abnormalities in frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes and basal
	ganglia of both hemispheres. This included abundant, sarkosyl-insoluble
	4R-tau in both gray and white matter of two or more of these cortical
	regions and basal ganglia, and to a lesser extent, cerebellar white
	matter. The insoluble tau pathology in gray and white matter showed
	overlapping but distinct phosphorylated epitopes suggesting cell-type
	and subcellular localization (ie, cell bodies versus cell processes)-specific
	differences in tau phosphorylation. In contrast, soluble tau was
	composed of normal 4R/3R-tau ratios indicating no gross abnormality
	in tau splicing. Thus, although clinically heterogeneous, CBD is
	a distinct lobar and basal ganglionic tauopathy with selective aggregation
	of 4R-tau.},

	MRI data sets of 17 clinically diagnosed FTLD patients were acquired

	of 30 age-matched healthy controls. Patients were further subgrouped
	into behavioral variant FTLD (bvFTLD), progressive nonfluent aphasia

	frontal lobes (FL) and temporal lobes (TL) were determined by voxel-based
	volumetry based on SPM5 algorithms and a probabilistic brain atlas.
	MRI volumetry revealed frontal and temporal GM atrophy across FTLD
	patients, with further progression over time. Significant side asymmetry
	of TL volumes was found in SemD. The ratio of TL to FL volumes was
	significantly reduced in SemD and increased in bvFTLD. Using this
	ratio, 6/7 SemD patients and 5/6 bvFTLD patients could be correctly
	differentiated. TL/FL ratios in bvFTLD and SemD further diverged
	significantly over a time span of only 6 months. Rates of temporal
	GM loss per 6 months were 3-4\% in SemD, and 2.5\% for frontal GM
	loss in bvFTLD, and thereby clearly exceeded published cerebral volume
	loss in healthy elderly subjects. The study presents a fully automated,
	observer-independent volumetric assessment of regional atrophy which
	allows differentiation of FTLD subgroups. Its sensitivity for atrophy
	progression--even in such short intervals like 6 months--might benefit

	atrophy between PiC and {A}lzheimer's disease (AD), and among PiC
	subgroups, have not been studied quantitatively. OBJECTIVE: To compare
	volumetric measures among primary progressive aphasia (PPA), frontotemporal
	dementia (FTD) and AD; to assess association between brain atrophy
	and cognition. PATIENTS: Seventeen patients with PPA, 11 with FTD
	and 24 with probable AD were studied. METHODS: We measured total
	and regional volume quantitatively using {M}{R}{I} and computerized
	volumetry. Contributing factors were controlled statistically or
	by adopting brain volume ratios. We investigated the classifying
	power of volumetry and correlated regional brain volume with cognitive
	and language test scores. RESULTS: The ratio for fronto-temporo-central
	region was smaller on the left in PPA and on the right in FTD. AD
	and some PPA patients had smaller parietal lobes. The frontal ratios
	correctly classified 93\% of PPA and FTD patients, but only 50\%
	of the entire PiC and AD patients. Language-dependent examinations
	correlated with the left fronto-temporal volume. CONCLUSIONS: Brain
	atrophy differs in PPA, FTD and AD, but there is some morphological
	overlap between PiC and AD in parietal volumes. Focal brain atrophy
	is most consistently associated with language impairments.},

  abstract = {Primary progressive aphasia is a clinical syndrome that encompasses
	three major phenotypes: non-fluent/agrammatic, semantic and logopenic.
	These clinical entities have been associated with characteristic
	patterns of focal grey matter atrophy in left posterior frontoinsular,
	anterior temporal and left temporoparietal regions, respectively.
	Recently, network-level dysfunction has been hypothesized but research
	to date has focused largely on studying grey matter damage. The aim
	of this study was to assess the integrity of white matter tracts
	in the different primary progressive aphasia subtypes. We used diffusion
	tensor imaging in 48 individuals: nine non-fluent, nine semantic,
	nine logopenic and 21 age-matched controls. Probabilistic tractography
	was used to identify bilateral inferior longitudinal (anterior, middle,
	posterior) and uncinate fasciculi (referred to as the ventral pathway);
	and the superior longitudinal fasciculus segmented into its frontosupramarginal,
	frontoangular, frontotemporal and temporoparietal components, (referred
	to as the dorsal pathway). We compared the tracts' mean fractional
	anisotropy, axial, radial and mean diffusivities for each tract in
	the different diagnostic categories. The most prominent white matter
	changes were found in the dorsal pathways in non-fluent patients,
	in the two ventral pathways and the temporal components of the dorsal
	pathways in semantic variant, and in the temporoparietal component
	of the dorsal bundles in logopenic patients. Each of the primary
	progressive aphasia variants showed different patterns of diffusion
	tensor metrics alterations: non-fluent patients showed the greatest
	changes in fractional anisotropy and radial and mean diffusivities;
	semantic variant patients had severe changes in all metrics; and
	logopenic patients had the least white matter damage, mainly involving
	diffusivity, with fractional anisotropy altered only in the temporoparietal
	component of the dorsal pathway. This study demonstrates that both
	careful dissection of the main language tracts and consideration
	of all diffusion tensor metrics are necessary to characterize the
	white matter changes that occur in the variants of primary progressive
	aphasia. These results highlight the potential value of diffusion
	tensor imaging as a new tool in the multimodal diagnostic evaluation
	of primary progressive aphasia.},

	hypothesis that distinct patterns of gray matter atrophy are responsible
	for unique interruptions of the naming process in {A}lzheimer's disease
	(AD) and frontotemporal dementia ({F}{T}{D}). MATERI{A}{L}{S} AND
	METHODS: Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was performed to characterize
	at the voxel level the neuroanatomic changes that occur in {A}{D}
	and {F}{T}{D} based on high-resolution T1-weighted three-dimensional
	(3D) spoiled-gradient echo images of patients (AD, n = 12; {F}{T}{D},
	n = 29) and healthy control subjects (n = 12). The cortical atrophy
	measurements were correlated with performance on behavioral measures
	of naming and related processes to identify brain regions that may
	contribute to this language function. RESULTS: Both {A}{D} and {F}{T}{D}
	have significant naming difficulty, and this difficulty in naming
	correlates with a measure of lexical retrieval in both patient groups
	as well. However, only {F}{T}{D} patients showed a correlation with
	semantic memory. Areas of cortical atrophy common to {A}{D} and {F}{T}{D}
	were found in the anterior temporal, posterolateral temporal, and
	dorsolateral prefrontal regions of the left hemisphere. Correlation
	with naming in both {A}{D} and {F}{T}{D} was seen in the left anterior
	temporal cortex, suggesting that this area may play a role in the
	lexical retrieval component of naming. We also observed several unique
	areas of cortical atrophy in temporal and frontal cortices of these
	patients. Right anterior temporal and left posterolateral temporal
	regions of atrophy correlated with naming difficulty in {F}{T}{D},
	suggesting that these areas may contribute to the semantic memory
	component of naming. Cortical areas correlating with naming that
	are not atrophic may represent regions that play an optional role
	in naming. CONCLUSION: VBM provides an important first step in analyzing
	brain-behavior relations in vivo in patients with neurodegenerative
	diseases. More refined analyses of brain morphology via high-dimensional
	normalization methods that are capable of modeling local as well
	as global variability in neuroanatomical structure promise to be
	even more informative.},

	reduction. In S-Isomap, the neighborhood graph of the input data
	is constructed according to a certain kind of dissimilarity between
	data points, which is specially designed to integrate the class information.
	The dissimilarity has several good properties which help to discover
	the true neighborhood of the data and, thus, makes S-Isomap a robust
	technique for both visualization and classification, especially for
	real-world problems. In the visualization experiments, S-Isomap is
	compared with Isomap, {LLE}, and {WeightedIso.} The results show
	that S-Isomap performs the best. In the classification experiments,
	S-Isomap is used as a preprocess of classification and compared with
	Isomap, {WeightedIso}, as well as some other well-established classification
	methods, including the K-nearest neighbor classifier, {BP} neural
	network, J4.8 decision tree, and {SVM.} The results reveal that S-Isomap
	excels compared to Isomap and {WeightedIso} in classification, and
	it is highly competitive with those well-known classification methods.},

  abstract = {Peer-reviewed publications are the primary mechanism for sharing
	scientific results. The current peer-review process is, however,
	fraught with many problems that undermine the pace, validity, and
	credibility of science. We highlight five salient problems: (1) reviewers
	are expected to have comprehensive expertise; (2) reviewers do not
	have sufficient access to methods and materials to evaluate a study;
	(3) reviewers are neither identified nor acknowledged; (4) there
	is no measure of the quality of a review; and (5) reviews take a
	lot of time, and once submitted cannot evolve. We propose that these
	problems can be resolved by making the following changes to the review
	process. Distributing reviews to many reviewers would allow each
	reviewer to focus on portions of the article that reflect the reviewer's
	specialty or area of interest and place less of a burden on any one
	reviewer. Providing reviewers materials and methods to perform comprehensive
	evaluation would facilitate transparency, greater scrutiny, and replication
	of results. Acknowledging reviewers makes it possible to quantitatively
	assess reviewer contributions, which could be used to establish the
	impact of the reviewer in the scientific community. Quantifying review
	quality could help establish the importance of individual reviews
	and reviewers as well as the submitted article. Finally, we recommend
	expediting post-publication reviews and allowing for the dialog to
	continue and flourish in a dynamic and interactive manner. We argue
	that these solutions can be implemented by adapting existing features
	from open-source software management and social networking technologies.
	We propose a model of an open, interactive review system that quantifies
	the significance of articles, the quality of reviews, and the reputation

  abstract = {Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration
	(FTLD) are extremes of a clinically, pathologically, and genetically
	overlapping disease spectrum. A locus on chromosome 9p21 has been
	associated with both disorders, and we aimed to identify the causal
	gene within this region.We studied 305 patients with FTLD, 137 with
	ALS, and 23 with concomitant FTLD and ALS (FTLD-ALS) and 856 controls
	from Flanders (Belgium); patients were identified from a hospital-based
	cohort and were negative for mutations in known FTLD and ALS genes.
	We also examined the family of one patient with FTLD-ALS previously
	linked to 9p21 (family DR14). We analysed 130 kbp at 9p21 in association
	and segregation studies, genomic sequencing, repeat genotyping, and
	expression studies to identify the causal mutation. We compared genotype-phenotype
	correlations between mutation carriers and non-carriers.In the patient-control
	cohort, the single-nucleotide polymorphism rs28140707 within the
	130 kbp region of 9p21 was associated with disease (odds ratio [OR]
	2·6, 95\% CI 1·5-4·7; p=0·001). A GGGGCC repeat expansion in C9orf72
	completely co-segregated with disease in family DR14. The association
	of rs28140707 with disease in the patient-control cohort was abolished
	when we excluded GGGGCC repeat expansion carriers. In patients with
	familial disease, six (86\%) of seven with FTLD-ALS, seven (47\%)
	of 15 with ALS, and 12 (16\%) of 75 with FTLD had the repeat expansion.
	In patients without known familial disease, one (6\%) of 16 with
	FTLD-ALS, six (5\%) of 122 with ALS, and nine (4\%) of 230 with FTLD
	had the repeat expansion. Mutation carriers primarily presented with
	classic ALS (10 of 11 individuals) or behavioural variant FTLD (14
	of 15 individuals). Mean age at onset of FTLD was 55·3 years (SD
	8·4) in 21 mutation carriers and 63·2 years (9·6) in 284 non-carriers
	(p=0·001); mean age at onset of ALS was 54·5 years (9·9) in 13 carriers
	and 60·4 years (11·4) in 124 non-carriers. Postmortem neuropathological
	analysis of the brains of three mutation carriers with FTLD showed
	a notably low TDP-43 load. In brain at postmortem, C9orf72 expression
	was reduced by nearly 50\% in two carriers compared with nine controls
	(p=0·034). In familial patients, 14\% of FTLD-ALS, 50\% of ALS, and
	62\% of FTLD was not accounted for by known disease genes.We identified
	a pathogenic GGGGCC repeat expansion in C9orf72 on chromosome 9p21,
	as recently also reported in two other studies. The GGGGCC repeat
	expansion is highly penetrant, explaining all of the contribution
	of chromosome 9p21 to FTLD and ALS in the Flanders-Belgian cohort.
	Decreased expression of C9orf72 in brain suggests haploinsufficiency
	as an underlying disease mechanism. Unidentified genes probably also
	contribute to the FTLD-ALS disease spectrum.Full funding sources

  abstract = {Although the pathological hallmarks of {A}lzheimer's disease (AD)
	and frontal variant frontotemporal dementia (fvFTD) predict different
	cognitive patterns, many comparative neuropsychological studies showed
	no difference in the expected cognitive domains. Inconsistencies
	in diagnostic criteria, small cohorts of patients, and neuropsychological
	assessment may account for such findings. Moreover, discrepancies
	in memory and executive dysfunctions that are expected to distinguish
	AD and fvFTD may reflect the basic brain organization. Adhering to
	a strict concordance of clinical and neuroradiological criteria,
	we compared many patients with AD and fvFTD using a large neuropsychological
	battery. One hundred and thirty-nine patients with AD (n=89) or fvFTD
	(n=50) were retrospectively considered in order to verify the diagnostic
	congruence of clinical and neuroradiological aspects. On this basis,
	117 patients with AD (n=77) or fvFTD (n=40) with similar duration
	and severity of dementia were selected. Ninety-one healthy subjects
	were also controlled. Mean scores in tests for abstract reasoning,
	planning, set shifting, initiative, verbal fluency, immediate and
	episodic memory, constructive, ideomotor and orofacial praxis, selective
	and divided attention, visuomotor coordination, and visual perception
	were evaluated. Separate analyses of variance and post hoc Bonferroni
	tests showed that, with respect to controls, both patient groups
	were significantly impaired in all neuropsychological tests. Compared
	to fvFTD patients, AD patients were significantly impaired in episodic
	memory, selective attention, visual perception, visuomotor coordination,
	and constructive praxis, whereas no differences were found in executive,
	intellective, and linguistic abilities between the two patient groups.
	Logistic regression analyses revealed that episodic memory significantly
	predicted the diagnosis of AD while no executive deficit was able
	to predict the diagnosis of fvFTD. To conclude, memory, attention,
	and visuoconstructive deficits may distinguish AD with respect to
	fvFTD, in accordance with the severe temporo-parietal-occipital degeneration
	characterizing AD, but no executive impairment is consistently able
	to identify a relative compromise in fvFTD. Executive functions impairments
	possibly reflect the altered spatial-temporal integration of the
	frontal lobes with different brain areas, which prevents a clear-cut
	cognitive-brain correlation.},

	that quantitative magnetization transfer (qMT), an extension of magnetization
	transfer imaging, provides complementary information to conventional
	magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the characterisation of Alzheimer's
	disease (AD). The aim of this study was to extend these findings
	to the whole brain, using a voxel-wise approach. We recruited 19AD
	patients and 11 healthy subjects (HS). All subjects had an MRI acquisition
	at 3.0T including a T(1)-weighted volume, 12 MT-weighted volumes
	for qMT, and data for computing T(1) and B(1) maps. The T(1)-weighted
	volumes were processed to yield grey matter (GM) volumetric maps,
	while the other sequences were used to compute qMT parametric maps
	of the whole brain. qMT maps were warped to standard space and smoothed,
	and subsequently compared between groups. Of all the qMT parameters
	considered, only the forward exchange rate, RM(0)(B), showed significant
	group differences. These images were therefore retained for the multimodal
	statistical analysis, designed to locate brain regions of RM(0)(B)
	differences between AD and HS groups, adjusting for local GM atrophy.
	Widespread areas of reduced RM(0)(B) were found in AD patients, mainly
	located in the hippocampus, in the temporal lobe, in the posterior
	cingulate and in the parietal cortex. These results indicate that,
	among qMT parameters, RM(0)(B) is the most sensitive to AD pathology.
	This quantity is altered in the hippocampus of patients with AD (as
	found by previous works) but also in other brain areas, that PET
	studies have highlighted as involved with both, reduced glucose metabolism
	and amyloid ? deposition. RM(0)(B) might reflect, through the measurement
	of the efficiency of MT exchange, some information with a specific
	pathological counterpart. Given previous evidence of a strict relationship
	between RM(0)(B) and intracellular pH, an intriguing speculation
	is that our findings might reflect metabolic changes related to mitochondrial

	We use two statistical models. First, an {ANOVA} relates covariates
	to normalized similarity scores. Second, logistic regression relates
	subject covariates to probability of rank one recognition. These
	models have strong explanatory power as measured by R$^{\textrm{2}}$
	and deviance reduction, while providing complementary and corroborative
	results. Some factors, like changes to the eye status, affect all
	algorithms similarly. Other factors, such as race, affect different
	algorithms differently. Tabular and graphical summaries of results
	provide a wealth of empirical evidence. Plausible explanations of

	great challenge in computer-based automated recognition research.
	One difficulty in face recognition is how to handle the variations
	in expression, pose, and illumination when only a limited number
	of training samples are available. In this paper, an Improved Principal
	Component Analysis {(IPCA)} is proposed for face recognition. Initially
	the eigenspace is created with eigenvalues and eigenvectors. From
	this space, the eigenfaces are constructed, and the most relevant
	eigenfaces have been selected using {IPCA.} With these eigenfaces,
	the input images are be classified based on Euclidian distance. The
	proposed method was tested on {ORL} face database. Experimental results
	on this database demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method
	for face recognition with less misclassification in comparison with
	previous methods. © 2010 {IEEE.}},

	need to be selected. The algorithms have been tested in a variety

	patients with FTLD (11 behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia
	[bvFTD], 11 semantic dementia [SemD], 10 progressive nonfluent aphasia
	[PNFA]) and 24 age-matched healthy controls were assessed using volumetric
	brain MRI and standard behavioral measures (Mini-Mental State Examination,
	Frontal Assessment Battery, Clinical Dementia Rating Scale, Neuropsychiatric
	Inventory with Caregiver Distress scale) at baseline and 1 year later.
	A semi-automated image registration protocol was used to calculate
	annualized rates of brain atrophy (brain boundary shift integral
	[BBSI]) and ventricular expansion (ventricular boundary shift integral
	[VBSI]). Associations between these rates and changes in behavioral
	indices were investigated.Rates of whole brain atrophy were greater
	in the entire FTLD cohort and in each subgroup compared with controls
	(all p < or = 0.004). Rates of ventricular expansion were greater
	in the entire cohort (p < 0.001) and the SemD (p = 0.002) and PNFA
	(p = 0.05) subgroups compared with controls. Changes in Mini-Mental
	State Examination, Frontal Assessment Battery, and Clinical Dementia
	Rating Scale scores were associated with MRI measures of progression,
	though not uniformly across FTLD subgroups. Both BBSI and VBSI yielded
	feasible sample size estimates for detecting meaningful treatment
	effects in SemD and PNFA language subgroups. Sample sizes were substantially
	larger using MRI biomarkers for the bvFTD subgroup, and using behavioral
	biomarkers in general.Semi-automated MRI atrophy measures are potentially
	useful objective biomarkers of progression in frontotemporal lobar
	degeneration (FTLD); however, careful stratification of FTLD subtypes
	will be important in future clinical trials of disease-modifying

  abstract = {We performed a comprehensive cognitive, neuroimaging, and genetic
	study of 31 patients with primary progressive aphasia (PPA), a decline
	in language functions that remains isolated for at least 2 years.
	Detailed speech and language evaluation was used to identify three
	different clinical variants: nonfluent progressive aphasia (NFPA;
	n = 11), semantic dementia (SD; n = 10), and a third variant termed
	logopenic progressive aphasia (LPA; n = 10). Voxel-based morphometry
	(VBM) on {M}{R}{I}s showed that, when all 31 PPA patients were analyzed
	together, the left perisylvian region and the anterior temporal lobes
	were atrophied. However, when each clinical variant was considered
	separately, distinctive patterns emerged: (1) NFPA, characterized
	by apraxia of speech and deficits in processing complex syntax, was
	associated with left inferior frontal and insular atrophy; (2) SD,
	characterized by fluent speech and semantic memory deficits, was
	associated with anterior temporal damage; and (3) LPA, characterized
	by slow speech and impaired syntactic comprehension and naming, showed
	atrophy in the left posterior temporal cortex and inferior parietal
	lobule. Apolipoprotein E epsilon4 haplotype frequency was 20\% in
	NFPA, 0\% in SD, and 67\% in LPA. Cognitive, genetic, and anatomical
	features indicate that different PPA clinical variants may correspond
	to different underlying pathological processes.},

	During functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning, young and

	was roughly matched at 80\% across tasks and groups. Modulations
	of activity across conditions were assessed, as well as functional
	connectivity of both networks. Younger adults showed a broader engagement

	Functional connectivity in the DMN was reduced in older adults, whereas
	the main pattern of TPN connectivity was equivalent in the 2 groups.
	Age-specific connectivity also was seen in TPN regions. Increased
	activity in TPN areas predicted worse accuracy on the tasks, but
	greater expression of a connectivity pattern associated with a right
	dorsolateral prefrontal TPN region, seen only in older adults, predicted
	better performance. These results provide further evidence for age-related
	differences in the DMN and new evidence of age differences in the

	imaging [MRI]) and functional (single photon emission computed tomography
	[SPECT]) imaging and neuropsychologic evaluation in the early diagnosis
	of frontal variant frontotemporal dementia (fvFTD). BACKGROUND: Current
	criteria for FTD stress the need for neuropsychologic and functional
	neuroimaging abnormalities, yet caregivers report lengthy histories
	of behavioral change. It is not known when, in the course of the
	disease, these investigations become abnormal, because few longitudinal
	studies have been reported. METHOD: Longitudinal study of two patients
	with serial neuropsychologic evaluation and MRI and HMPAO-SPECT scanning.
	RESULTS: Both patients, men aged 49 and 50, had major changes in
	personality, behavior, and social conduct that progressed over 5
	to 6 years in a way that conformed to the clinical picture of fvFTD.
	There was remarkably little abnormality on neuropsychologic testing,
	and MRI and HMPAO-SPECT findings initially were normal. Over time,
	however, abnormalities on SPECT, frontal atrophy on MRI, or a neuropsychologic
	profile more typical of fvFTD developed in both patients. CONCLUSIONS:
	Standard neuropsychologic tests and conventional brain imaging techniques
	(MRI and SPECT) may not be sensitive to the early changes in fvFTD
	that occur in the ventromedial frontal cortex, and better methods
	of accurate early detection are required. These findings are relevant
	to the diagnostic criteria for FTD.},

	to directly predicting behavioral output. With spatial resolution

	of seconds, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a promising
	technology for such applications. However, fMRI data's low signal-to-noise

	Our goal was to improve spatiotemporal interpretability as well as
	classification accuracy. To this end, sparse penalized discriminant
	analysis (SPDA) enabled automatic selection of correlated variables,
	yielding interpretable models that generalized well to new data.
	Relative to logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, and
	linear support vector machines, SPDA not only increased interpretability
	but also improved classification accuracy. SPDA promises to allow
	more precise inferences about when specific brain regions contribute
	to purchasing decisions. More broadly, this approach provides a general

  title = {Interpretable whole-brain prediction analysis with GraphNet.},
  journal = {Neuroimage},
  year = {2013},
  month = {Jan},
  abstract = {Multivariate machine learning methods are increasingly used to analyze
	neuroimaging data, often replacing more traditional "mass univariate"
	techniques that fit data one voxel at a time. In the functional magnetic
	resonance imaging (fMRI) literature, this has led to broad application
	of "off-the-shelf" classification and regression methods. These generic
	approaches allow investigators to use ready-made algorithms to accurately
	decode perceptual, cognitive, or behavioral states from distributed
	patterns of neural activity. However, when applied to correlated
	whole-brain fMRI data these methods suffer from coefficient instability,
	are sensitive to outliers, and yield dense solutions that are hard
	to interpret without arbitrary thresholding. Here, we develop variants
	of the Graph-constrained Elastic Net (GraphNet), a fast, whole-brain
	regression and classification method developed for spatially and
	temporally correlated data that automatically yields interpretable
	coefficient maps (Grosenick et al., 2009b). GraphNet methods yield
	sparse but structured solutions by combining structured graph constraints
	(based on knowledge about coefficient smoothness or connectivity)
	with a global sparsity-inducing prior that automatically selects
	important variables. Because GraphNet methods can efficiently fit
	regression or classification models to whole-brain, multiple time-point
	data sets and enhance classification accuracy relative to volume-of-interest
	(VOI) approaches, they eliminate the need for inherently biased VOI
	analyses and allow whole-brain fitting without the multiple comparison
	problems that plague mass univariate and roaming VOI ("searchlight")
	methods. As fMRI data are unlikely to be normally distributed, we
	(1) extend GraphNet to include robust loss functions that confer
	insensitivity to outliers, (2) equip them with "adaptive" penalties
	that asymptotically guarantee correct variable selection, and (3)
	develop a novel sparse structured Support Vector GraphNet classifier
	(SVGN). When applied to previously published data (Knutson et al.,
	2007), these efficient whole-brain methods significantly improved
	classification accuracy over previously reported VOI-based analyses
	on the same data (Grosenick et al., 2008; Knutson et al., 2007) while
	discovering task-related regions not documented in the original VOI
	approach. Critically, GraphNet estimates fit to the Knutson et al.
	(2007) data generalize well to out-of-sample data collected more
	than three years later on the same task but with different subjects
	and stimuli (Karmarkar et al., submitted for publication). By enabling
	robust and efficient selection of important voxels from whole-brain
	data taken over multiple time points (>100,000 "features"), these
	methods enable data-driven selection of brain areas that accurately
	predict single-trial behavior within and across individuals.},

	components of sentence processing in the full range of patients with
	Lewy body spectrum disorder (LBSD). Thirty-three patients with LBSD

  abstract = {This review summarizes clinical and imaging features associated with
	primary progressive aphasia (PPA). We investigate the hypothesis
	that these patients can be divided into subgroups of progressive
	non-fluent aphasia (PNFA) and semantic dementia (SD), based on their
	linguistic profiles and related imaging studies, and examine whether
	each of these major subgroups can be further subdivided. We focus
	on several critical features within each progressive aphasic subgroup.
	In PNFA, we examine agrammatism, phonologic disorder, and impaired
	verb processing to determine whether this syndrome is related to
	a modality-specific impairment in word formation and articulation,
	or a conceptual deficit that interferes with grammatical processing.
	In SD, we examine impaired semantic memory, limited remote memory,
	and anomia to assess whether this syndrome is due to a modality-neutral
	interruption of semantic memory, or the degradation of various material-specific
	representations of object features and words. We conclude that there
	is sufficiently consistent and converging evidence from clinical
	and imaging studies to support the claim that PNFA and SD are distinct
	subgroups of PPA. However, there does not appear to be sufficient
	evidence at this point to support further discrimination within these
	progressive aphasic subgroups. Testing hypotheses about finer-grained
	syndromes such as progressive dysarthria or progressive anomia has
	important consequences for improving our understanding of language
	organization and the neural basis for language.},

  abstract = {The ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) has been implicated
	in social and affectively influenced decision-making. Disease in
	this region may have clinical consequences for social judgments in
	patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). To test this
	hypothesis, regional cortical activation was monitored with fMRI
	while healthy adults judged the acceptability of brief social scenarios
	such as cutting into a movie ticket line or going through a red light
	at 2 AM. The scenarios described: (i) a socially neutral condition,
	(ii) a variant of each scenario containing a negatively valenced
	feature, and (iii) a variant containing a positively valenced feature.
	Results revealed that healthy adults activated vmPFC during judgments
	of negatively valenced scenarios relative to positive scenarios and
	neutral scenarios. In a comparative behavioral study, the same social
	decision-making paradigm was administered to patients with a social
	disorder due to FTLD. Patients differed significantly from healthy
	controls, specifically showing less sensitivity to negatively valenced
	features. Comparative anatomical analysis revealed considerable overlap
	of vmPFC activation in healthy adults and vmPFC cortical atrophy
	in FTLD patients. These converging results support the role of vmPFC
	in social decision-making where potentially negative consequences

	Academic medical center. Patients Sixty-one participants with the
	clinical diagnosis of a frontotemporal spectrum disorder who underwent
	a neuropsychological evaluation and had an autopsy-confirmed disease.
	MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Neuropsychological performance and high-resolution
	structural magnetic resonance imaging ({M}{R}{I}). RESULTS: Distinguishing
	features of patients with tau-positive FTD include visual perceptual-spatial
	difficulty and an extrapyramidal disorder significantly more often
	than other patients, significant cortical atrophy in the frontal
	and parietal regions as evidenced on {M}{R}{I}, and the burden of
	pathology is greatest in the frontal and parietal regions. Patients
	with tau-negative FTD are distinguished by their greater difficulties
	with social, language, and verbally mediated executive functions,
	significant cortical atrophy in the frontal and temporal regions
	as evidenced on {M}{R}{I}, and significant frontal and temporal pathology.
	Patients with {A}lzheimer disease at autopsy have significantly impaired
	delayed recall during episodic memory testing; atrophy that involves
	temporal areas, including the hippocampus, as evidenced on {M}{R}{I};
	and widely distributed pathology including the medial temporal structures.
	A discriminant function analysis grouped patients on the basis of

	with histopathologically proven FTLD-U. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Demographic,
	symptom, neuropsychological, and autopsy characteristics. RESULTS:
	There are notably different clinical and neuropsychological patterns
	of impairment in FTLD-U subtypes. Patients with FTLD-U/TDP-43 characterized
	by numerous neuronal intracytoplasmic inclusions have shorter survival;
	patients with FTLD-U/TDP-43 featuring numerous neurites have difficulty
	with object naming; and patients with FTLD-U/TDP-43 in whom neuronal
	intranuclear inclusions are present have substantial executive deficits.
	There are also different anatomical distributions of ubiquitin pathologic
	features in FTLD-U subgroups, consistent with their cognitive deficits.
	CONCLUSION: Distinct TDP-43 profiles may affect clinical phenotypes
	differentially in patients with FTLD-U.},

	to grammatic, motor-speech planning, and executive aspects of patient
	functioning. These measures were then related to cortical thickness
	in 8 patients with PNFA and 7 patients with bvFTD using structural
	MRI.WPM was significantly reduced in patients with PNFA relative
	to controls and patients with bvFTD. Regression analyses revealed
	that only grammatic measures predicted WPM in PNFA, whereas executive
	measures were the only significant predictor of WPM in bvFTD. Cortical
	thinning was significant in PNFA relative to controls in left inferior
	frontal and anterior-superior temporal regions, and a regression
	analysis related this area to reduced WPM in PNFA. Significant cortical
	thinning associated with limited grammatic processing also was seen
	in the left inferior frontal-superior temporal region in PNFA, and
	this overlapped with the area of frontal-temporal thinning related

	non-Alzheimer type (FLD) was the second most common primary degenerative
	dementia found in about 10\% of the material. FLD has a consistent
	pathology and a characteristic clinical picture, which have been
	described by several independent research groups. The cortical degeneration
	mainly involves frontal or frontotemporal grey matter, without the
	circumscribed or knife-blade atrophy seen in Pick's disease. The
	degeneration involves predominantly frontal areas, including the
	insula and cingulate gyrus in its anterior parts. The striate body
	is normal or only slightly altered. The pathological changes are
	non-specific, with neuronal loss, slight gliosis and spongiosis but
	none or few senile plaques, tangles, congophilic vessels or Pick
	cells. Pathological changes are in some respects similar to those
	in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. FLD is a slowly progressive dementia
	with personality changes, lack of insight, disinhibition, stereotypy
	and later apathy. There is also progressive dynamic aphasia which
	ends in mutism and amimia. Memory, spatial ability and receptive
	language functions are comparatively spared. Psychotic symptoms,
	emotional reactions, hypochondriasis and a Klüver-Bucy-like syndrome
	are sometimes observed. Electroencephalography is normal, at least
	during the early stage, while functional brain imaging such as regional
	cerebral blood flow reflects the frontal pathology. It is possible
	to achieve early diagnosis and differentiation from Alzheimer's disease
	and cerebrovascular dementia by clinical examination with neuropsychological
	assessment supported by brain imaging, and in the future probably
	various biological markers. The aetiology is unknown but there is

	there was a high inter-rater agreement for cases with probable and
	definite Alzheimer's disease but low agreement for cases with possible
	Alzheimer's disease. Braak staging and the application of criteria
	for dementia with Lewy bodies also resulted in high inter-rater agreement.
	There was poor agreement for the diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia
	and for identifying small vessel disease. Participants rarely diagnosed
	more than one disease in any case. To improve efficiency when applying
	multiple diagnostic criteria, several simplifications were proposed
	and tested on 5 of the original 20 cases. Inter-rater reliability

	All {A}lzheimer's disease patients had prospectively documented impairments
	in verbal and semantic memory with concomitant global decline. The
	cortical regions of interest included the planum temporale, Heschl's
	gyri, the anterior superior temporal gyri, the middle and inferior
	temporal gyri, area 37 at the inferior temporoparietal junction,
	areas 40 and 39 (supramarginal and angular gyri) and Broca's frontal

	cortical regions were affected to different degrees, with some regions
	free of atrophy. These included Broca's regions in the frontal lobe
	and Heschl's gyri on the superior surface of the temporal lobe. In
	contrast, the inferior temporal and temporoparietal gyri (area 37)
	were severely reduced in volume. The phonological processing regions
	in the superior temporal gyri (the planum temporale) were also atrophic
	in all {A}lzheimer's disease patients while the anterior superior

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare the pattern of cortical degeneration associated
	with different language deficits in cases of AD. METHODS: Cases for
	detailed neuropathologic analysis (Patients 1 and 2) were selected
	because of their detailed clinical and neuropsychological assessments
	of language dysfunction in AD. Patient 1 had severe phonologic impairment
	with relatively preserved semantic aspects of language. Patient 2
	had severe semantic language impairment with relatively preserved
	phonologic skills. The tissue volume of cortical regions associated
	with speech and language function was measured using standardized
	three-dimensional techniques. Neuronal areal fraction was also measured
	from histologic tissue samples. The degree of volume atrophy and
	neuronal loss was calculated in comparison to control measures (n
	= 10 men and 11 women). Measurements more than 2 SD from controls
	were considered abnormal. RESULTS: Both AD cases had significant
	degeneration of the superior temporal gyrus and area 37. Cortical
	language regions affected only in Patient 1 included the anterior
	and posterior insula and part of Broca's area. In contrast, Patient
	2 had a greater degree of degeneration in the temporal gyri and their
	white matter connections with the hippocampal/entorhinal complex.
	CONCLUSIONS: Variable patterns of neurodegeneration underlie the
	clinical differences observed in patients with AD. Disconnection
	within the temporal lobe appears associated with semantic language
	difficulties, whereas disconnection of the anterior and posterior
	language areas appears associated with phonologic and grammatical

	During wound repair it promotes granulation and neovascularization.
	It regulates inflammation through a tripartite loop with secretory
	leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI) which protects pgrn from proteolysis,

	Pgrn is highly expressed in aggressive cancer cell lines and clinical

	where the number of covariates p can be much larger than the sam-
	ple size n. In such a situation, one often assumes sparsity of the
	regression vector, i.e., the regression vector contains many zero
	components. We pro- pose a Lasso-type estimator ? Quad (where {'Quad'}
	stands for quadratic) which is based on two penalty terms. The first
	one is the ? 1 norm of the re- gression coefficients used to exploit
	the sparsity of the regression as done by the Lasso estimator, whereas
	the second is a quadratic penalty term intro- duced to capture some
	additional information on the setting of the problem. We detail two
	special cases: the Elastic-Net ? {EN} introduced in. [42], which
	deals with sparse problems where correlations between variables may
	exist; and the Smooth-Lasso† ? {SL}, which responds to sparse problems
	where successive regression coefficients are known to vary slowly
	(in some situations, this can also be interpreted in terms of correlations
	between successive variables). From a theoretical point of view,
	we establish variable selection consistency results and show that
	{?Quad} achieves a Sparsity Inequality, i.e., a bound in terms of
	the number of non-zero components of the 'true' regression vector.
	These results are provided under a weaker assumption on the Gram
	matrix than the one used by the Lasso. In some situations this guarantees
	a significant improvement over the Lasso. Furthermore, a simulation
	study is conducted and shows that the S-Lasso ? {SL} performs better
	than known methods as the Lasso, the Elastic-Net ? {EN}, and the
	Fused-Lasso (introduced in. [30]) with respect to the estimation
	accuracy. This is especially the case when the regression vector
	is 'smooth', i.e., when the variations between successive coefficients
	of the unknown parameter of the regression are small. The study also
	reveals that the theoretical calibration of the tuning parameters

	modulator of the adrenal glucocorticoid stress response. Activation
	of this axis occurs by way of a discrete set of neurons in the hypothalamic
	paraventricular nucleus (PVN). The PVN neuron appears to be affected
	by multiple sources, including (1) brainstem aminergic/peptidergic
	afferents; (2) blood-borne information; (3) indirect input from limbic
	system-associated regions, including the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus,
	and amygdala; and (4) local-circuit interactions with the preoptic-hypothalamic
	continuum. Analysis of the literature suggests that different classes
	of stressor employ different stress circuits. Severe physiologic
	("systemic") stress appears to trigger brainstem/circumventricular
	organ systems that project directly to the paraventricular nucleus.
	In contrast, stressors requiring interpretation with respect to previous
	experience ("processive" stressors) reach the PVN by way of multisynaptic
	limbic pathways. Limbic regions mediating processive stress responses
	appear to have bisynaptic connections with the PVN, forming intervening
	connections with preoptic/hypothalamic GABAergic neurons. Stressors
	of the latter category may thus require interaction with homeostatic
	information prior to promoting an HPA response. The HPA stress response
	thus appears to be a product of both the physiologic importance of
	the stimulus and the specific pathways a given stimulus excites.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To establish survival in patients with pathologically
	confirmed frontotemporal dementia ({F}{T}{D}) and to determine whether
	clinical or pathologic subtype affects prognosis. METHODS: The authors
	reviewed the presenting clinical features of 61 patients with dementia
	and pathologically confirmed {F}{T}{D} studied in Sydney (n = 31)
	and Cambridge (n = 30) over a 10-year period. Data were available
	on time of symptom onset, diagnosis, institutionalization, and death.
	Cases were classified pathologically as tau-positive and tau-negative.
	RESULTS: Of the 61 patients with {F}{T}{D}, 26 presented with frontal
	variant (fv{F}{T}{D}), 9 with semantic dementia, 8 with progressive
	nonfluent aphasia (PNFA), 9 with associated motor neuron disease
	({F}{T}{D}-MND), and 9 with corticobasal degeneration features. There
	was no difference between the groups in age at symptom onset (overall
	mean 58.5 +/- 7.8 years), but at diagnosis the PNFA (68.3 +/- 2.7)
	group was significantly older than the fv{F}{T}{D} (59.9 +/- 7.4)
	and {F}{T}{D}-MND (57.7 +/- 7.9) groups. The median survival from
	symptom onset and from diagnosis was 6 +/- 1.1 years (95\% CI) for
	fv{F}{T}{D} and 3 +/- 0.4 years for {F}{T}{D}-MND. Survival across
	subgroups was equivalent except for the {F}{T}{D}-MND group, which
	had significantly shorter survival. Cases with tau-positive pathology
	had an older age at onset and a significantly better prognosis: median
	survival 9.0 +/- 0.9 years vs 5.0 +/- 1.1 years. CONCLUSIONS: {F}{T}{D}
	is a malignant disorder with limited life expectancy. {F}{T}{D}-MND
	has the shortest duration both before and after diagnosis. Tau-positivity
	is associated with a more slowly progressive form of {F}{T}{D}.},

	using serial magnetic resonance imaging scans, and provide powerful
	biomarkers for detecting and monitoring Alzheimer's disease. The
	Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) has made a large
	database of longitudinal scans available, with one of its primary
	goals being to explore the utility of structural change measures
	for assessing treatment effects in clinical trials of putative disease-modifying
	therapies. Several ADNI-funded research laboratories have calculated
	such measures from the ADNI database and made their results publicly
	available. Here, using sample size estimates, we present a comparative
	analysis of the overall results that come from the application of
	each laboratory's extensive processing stream to the ADNI database.
	Obtaining accurate measures of change requires correcting for potential
	bias due to the measurement methods themselves; and obtaining realistic
	sample size estimates for treatment response, based on longitudinal
	imaging measures from natural history studies such as ADNI, requires
	calibrating measured change in patient cohorts with respect to longitudinal
	anatomical changes inherent to normal aging. We present results showing
	that significant longitudinal change is present in healthy control
	subjects who test negative for amyloid-? pathology. Therefore, sample
	size estimates as commonly reported from power calculations based
	on total structural change in patients, rather than change in patients
	relative to change in healthy controls, are likely to be unrealistically
	low for treatments targeting amyloid-related pathology. Of all the
	measures publicly available in ADNI, thinning of the entorhinal cortex
	quantified with the Quarc methodology provides the most powerful

	as a subtype of frontotemporal lobar degeneration, termed "dementia
	lacking distinctive histopathology." We now report a reevaluation
	of the neuropathologic changes in this family. Postmortem material
	from 4 affected family members was available for examination. Gross
	examination revealed generalized cortical atrophy that was most severe
	in frontal and temporal cortices. Microscopy showed loss of cortical
	neurons, microvacuolation of layer II, mild gliosis, and demyelination
	of the deep white matter. Results of immunohistochemical staining
	for alpha-synuclein, prion protein, neurofilament, and tau protein
	were unremarkable. Variable numbers of small, round, ubiquitin-positive
	cytoplasmic inclusions were present in the dentate granule layer
	of the hippocampus in all 4 cases. Rare ubiquitin-positive inclusions
	were also found in frontal and temporal cortical neurons. These inclusions
	were also positive for p62 but not for TDP-43. The finding of ubiquitin-
	and p62-positive, TDP-43-negative cytoplasmic inclusions in the hippocampus
	and neocortex suggests reclassification of the neuropathology of
	FTD-3 as a unique subtype of frontotemporal lobar degeneration with
	ubiquitin-positive inclusions that are TDP-43-negative.},

	Functional connectivity has previously been shown to correlate with

	In the present study we investigate, with the aid of computational
	modeling, whether systems-level properties of functional networks—including
	their spatial statistics and their persistence across time—can be
	accounted for by properties of the underlying anatomical network.
	We measured resting state functional connectivity (using {fMRI)}
	and structural connectivity (using diffusion spectrum imaging tractography)
	in the same individuals at high resolution. Structural connectivity
	then provided the couplings for a model of macroscopic cortical dynamics.
	In both model and data, we observed (i) that strong functional connections
	commonly exist between regions with no direct structural connection,
	rendering the inference of structural connectivity from functional
	connectivity impractical; (ii) that indirect connections and interregional
	distance accounted for some of the variance in functional connectivity
	that was unexplained by direct structural connectivity; and (iii)
	that resting-state functional connectivity exhibits variability within
	and across both scanning sessions and model runs. These empirical
	and modeling results demonstrate that although resting state functional
	connectivity is variable and is frequently present between regions
	without direct structural linkage, its strength, persistence, and
	spatial statistics are nevertheless constrained by the large-scale
	anatomical structure of the human cerebral cortex.},

	higher than previously reported sample size estimates by a factor
	of 1.6 to 2.4. Importantly, estimates are far below those given in

	disease (AD) progression in therapeutic trials, including measures
	of structural brain change based on repeated scanning of patients
	with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Methods to compute brain change
	must be robust to scan quality. Biases may arise if any scans are

	first phase of Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI-1)
	from the first phase of Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative
	(ADNI-1) and assessed several sources of bias that can arise when

	part of a pipeline for tensor-based morphometry (TBM). In all healthy
	subjects who completed MRI scanning at screening, 6, 12, and 24months,
	brain atrophy was essentially linear with no detectable bias in longitudinal
	measures. In power analyses for clinical trials based on these change
	measures, only 39AD patients and 95 mild cognitive impairment (MCI)
	subjects were needed for a 24-month trial to detect a 25\% reduction

	Further sample size reductions were achieved by stratifying the data

	show how selective data exclusion affects sample size estimates,

	brain areas associated with executive dysfunction in these illnesses.
	METHOD: We administered the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System
	(D-KEFS), a collection of standardized executive function tests,
	to 51 patients with behavioral-variant FTD and 50 patients with CBS.
	We also performed a discriminant analysis on the D-KEFS to determine
	which executive function tests best distinguished the clinical diagnoses
	of FTD and CBS. Finally, we used voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to
	determine regional gray matter volume loss associated with executive
	dysfunction. RESULTS: Patients with FTD and patients with CBS showed
	executive dysfunction greater than memory dysfunction. Executive
	function was better preserved in the patients with CBS than the patients
	with FTD with the exception of tests that required motor, visuospatial
	ability, or both. In patients with CBS, dorsal frontal and parietal
	and temporal-parietal cortex was associated with executive function.
	In FTD, tests with a language component (Verbal Fluency) were associated
	with left perisylvian cortex, sorting with the left dorsolateral
	prefrontal cortex, and reasoning (the Twenty Questions task) with
	the left anterior frontal cortex. The Twenty Questions test best
	distinguished the clinical diagnoses of CBS and FTD. CONCLUSIONS:
	The neuroanatomic findings (especially in frontotemporal dementia
	[FTD]) agree with the previous literature on this topic. Patients
	with FTD and patients with corticobasal syndrome (CBS) show disparate
	performance on higher-order executive functions, especially the Twenty
	Questions test. It may be difficult to distinguish motor and visuospatial
	ability from executive function in patients with CBS using tests
	with significant motor and visuospatial demands such as Trail Making.},

	Twenty-one patients and twenty-three control subjects underwent {M}{R}{I}
	examination using T1-weighted 3D MPRAGE sequence and diffusion spin-echo
	echo-planar imaging sequence in six directions. Structural {M}{R}{I}
	analyses for GM volume and FA were performed using an optimized VBM
	protocol implemented in SPM5. The influence of age and Mini-Mental
	State Examination ({M}{M}{S}{E}) was dealt with multiple regression
	analysis either for the whole group or for AD patients and controls
	separately. RESULTS: Patients showed significant reduction of GM
	volume mainly in the temporal lobes. In AD patients, no correlation
	was observed between GM volume and age or {M}{M}{S}{E}. FA was reduced
	in AD patients mainly in frontal and temporal lobes. In both groups
	no correlation was found between FA and age or {M}{M}{S}{E}. Patients
	with AD showed a significant decrease in FA and an increase in mean
	diffusivity (p<0.0001) in the corpus callosum. CONCLUSIONS: In patients
	with AD we observed a significant reduction in FA values and GM volume;
	however, no correlation with age and {M}{M}{S}{E} was proven for
	both FA and GM for AD patients. This finding supports the hypothesis

	underlying TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) proteinopathy.A retrospective
	case-control study was carried out using available cross-sectional
	and longitudinal clinical and neuropsychological data, MRI voxel-based
	morphometry (VBM) and neuropathological assessment from 64 C9P cases
	(ALS=31, FTLD=33) and 79 C9N cases (ALS=36, FTLD=43).C9P cases had
	an earlier age of onset (p=0.047) and, in the subset of patients
	who were deceased, an earlier age of death (p=0.014) than C9N. C9P
	had more rapid progression than C9N: C9P ALS cases had a shortened
	survival (2.6±0.3 years) compared to C9N ALS (3.8±0.4 years; log-rank
	?2=4.183, p=0.041), and C9P FTLD showed a significantly greater annualised
	rate of decline in letter fluency (4.5±1.3 words/year) than C9N FTLD
	(1.4±0.8 words/year, p=0.023). VBM revealed greater atrophy in the
	right frontoinsular, thalamus, cerebellum and bilateral parietal
	regions for C9P FTLD relative to C9N FTLD, and regression analysis
	related verbal fluency scores to atrophy in frontal and parietal
	regions. Neuropathological analysis found greater neuronal loss in
	the mid-frontal cortex in C9P FTLD, and mid-frontal cortex TDP-43
	inclusion severity correlated with poor letter fluency performance.C9P
	cases may have a shorter survival in ALS and more rapid rate of cognitive
	decline related to frontal and parietal disease in FTLD. C9orf72
	genotyping may provide useful prognostic and diagnostic clinical
	information for patients with ALS and FTLD.},

  abstract = {Alzheimer disease (AD) is one of, if not the most, feared diseases
	associated with aging. The prevalence of AD increases exponentially
	with age after 60 years. Increasing life expectancy coupled with
	the absence of any approved disease-modifying therapies at present
	position AD as a dominant public health problem. Major advances have
	occurred in the development of disease biomarkers for AD in the past
	2 decades. At present, the most well-developed AD biomarkers are
	the cerebrospinal fluid analytes amyloid-? 42 and tau and the brain
	imaging measures amyloid positron emission tomography (PET), fluorodeoxyglucose
	PET, and magnetic resonance imaging. CSF and imaging biomarkers are
	incorporated into revised diagnostic guidelines for AD, which have
	recently been updated for the first time since their original formulation
	in 1984. Results of recent studies suggest the possibility of an
	ordered evolution of AD biomarker abnormalities that can be used
	to stage the typical 20-30-year course of the disease. When compared
	with biomarkers in other areas of medicine, however, the absence
	of standardized quantitative metrics for AD imaging biomarkers constitutes
	a major deficiency. Failure to move toward a standardized system
	of quantitative metrics has substantially limited potential diagnostic
	usefulness of imaging in AD. This presents an important opportunity
	that, if widely embraced, could greatly expand the application of
	imaging to improve clinical diagnosis and the quality and efficiency
	of clinical trials.},

	inhibition is implicated in habituation of HPA activity to repeated
	exposure to the same (homotypic) stressor. We hypothesized that the
	posterior paraventricular thalamus (pPVTh) is a site where corticosterone
	acts to exert negative feedback during repeated stress and that is
	important for habituation. As previously reported, the pPVTh inhibits
	HPA responses to homotypic and heterotypic stressors in repeatedly,
	but not acutely, stressed rats. We conducted a series of experiments
	involving intra-pPVTh administration of MR and/or GR agonists or
	antagonists during different time frames over 8 d of restraint. MR
	exist in the pPVTh, as do GR as shown by our immunocytochemical results.
	Acute intra-pPVTh injection of MR and/or GR antagonist before the
	eighth restraint did not alter expression of habituation. Because
	habituation may develop before d 8, we manipulated GR and MR in the
	pPVTh throughout 8 d of stress using intra-pPVTh corticosterone implants,
	which enhanced habituation on d 8 without affecting acute stress
	responses. Conversely, daily intra-pPVTh injections of GR and MR
	antagonists on d 1-7 of restraint prevented habituation on d 8. These
	data suggest that corticosterone released during repeated stress
	can act at GR and MR in the pPVTh to inhibit HPA responses to homotypic
	stress. We also found that some GR-containing cells in the pPVTh
	project to the medial prefrontal cortex and basolateral amygdala,
	suggesting that pPVTh-induced inhibition of HPA activity is potentially
	mediated by its projections to these select limbic structures.},

	increased on incorporating subjectwise in vivo blood T1 measurement

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Until recently, frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD)
	was considered a rare neurodegenerative disorder that was difficult
	to diagnose. The publication of consensus criteria for FTLD, however,
	prompted systematic studies. The criteria categorize FTLD into 3
	subgroups: frontotemporal dementia, semantic dementia, and progressive
	nonfluent aphasia. OBJECTIVE: To compare demographic characteristics
	of patients in the 3 FTLD subgroups. DESIGN: We compared diagnostic
	breakdown, age at onset, sex, Mini-Mental State Examination score
	at first visit, education, and neuropathological diagnoses in a large
	sample of FTLD patients from 3 different university dementia clinics,
	including 2 neurologic clinics in the United States and 1 psychiatric
	clinic in Germany. RESULTS: The frontotemporal dementia subgroup
	represented approximately half of all FTLD diagnoses. Patients diagnosed
	as having frontotemporal dementia (mean age, 57.5 years) and semantic
	dementia (mean age, 59.3 years) had an earlier age at onset than
	patients diagnosed as having progressive nonfluent aphasia (mean
	age, 63.0 years). There were significantly more men diagnosed as
	having frontotemporal dementia (63.5\%) and semantic dementia (66.7\%)
	when compared with progressive nonfluent aphasia (39.1\%) (P = .005
	for frontotemporal dementia vs progressive nonfluent aphasia and
	P = .002 for semantic dementia vs progressive nonfluent aphasia).
	Generally, the demographic features and diagnostic categories of
	the patient populations across the 3 sites were comparable. There
	were 68 deaths and 37 autopsies. Frontotemporal lobar degeneration
	with ubiquitin-positive tau-negative inclusions (48.5\%), dementia
	lacking distinctive histopathological features (18.2\%), and Pick
	disease (15.2\%) were the most common neuropathological diagnoses.
	CONCLUSIONS: These findings show that cohorts of patients can be
	combined using new research criteria for FTLD and demonstrate striking
	demographic differences among FTLD subgroups. The sex and age-at-onset
	differences suggest that there may be biological differences among
	FTLD subgroups. In this sample, FTLD with ubiquitin-positive inclusions
	accounted for half of all neuropathological diagnoses.},

  abstract = {In many multivariate statistical techniques, a set of linear functions
	of the original p variables is produced. One of the more difficult
	aspects of these techniques is the interpretation of the linear functions,
	as these functions usually have nonzero coefficients on all p variables.
	A common approach is to effectively ignore (treat as zero) any coefficients
	less than some threshold value, so that the function becomes simple
	and the interpretation becomes easier for the users. Such a procedure
	can be misleading. There are alternatives to principal component
	analysis which restrict the coefficients to a smaller number of possible
	values in the derivation of the linear functions, or replace the
	principal components by "principal variables." This article introduces
	a new technique, borrowing an idea proposed by Tibshirani in the
	context of multiple regression where similar problems arise in interpreting
	regression equations. This approach is the so-called {LASSO}, the
	"least absolute shrinkage and selection operator," in which a bound
	is introduced on the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients,
	and in which some coefficients consequently become zero. We explore
	some of the properties of the new technique, both theoretically and
	using simulation studies, and apply it to an example.},

	The fiber segmentation is carried out with a front propagation algorithm
	constructed to fill the whole fiber tract. The front is a {3D} surface
	that evolves with a propagation speed proportional to a measure indicating
	the similarity of diffusion between the tensors lying on the surface
	and their neighbors in the direction of propagation. We use a level
	set implementation to assure a stable and accurate evolution of the
	surface and to handle changes of topology of the surface during the
	evolution process. The fiber tract segmentation method does not need
	a regularized tensor field since the surface is automatically smoothed
	as it propagates. The smoothing is done by an intrinsic surface force,
	based on the minimal principal curvature. This segmentation can be
	used for obtaining quantitative measures of the diffusion in the
	fiber tracts and it can also be used for white matter registration

  abstract = {Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is the umbrella term encompassing
	a heterogeneous group of pathological disorders. With recent discoveries,
	the FTLDs have been show to classify nicely into three main groups
	based on the major protein deposited in the brain: FTLD-tau, FTLD-TDP
	and FTLD-FUS. These pathological groups, and their specific pathologies,
	underlie a number of well-defined clinical syndromes, including three
	frontotemporal dementia (FTD) variants [behavioral variant frontotemporal
	dementia (bvFTD), progressive non-fluent aphasia, and semantic dementia
	(SD)], progressive supranuclear palsy syndrome (PSPS) and corticobasal
	syndrome (CBS). Understanding the neuropathological background of
	the phenotypic variability in FTD, PSPS and CBS requires large clinicopathological
	studies. We review current knowledge on the relationship between
	the FTLD pathologies and clinical syndromes, and pool data from a
	number of large clinicopathological studies that collectively provide
	data on 544 cases. Strong relationships were identified as follows:
	FTD with motor neuron disease and FTLD-TDP; SD and FTLD-TDP; PSPS
	and FTLD-tau; and CBS and FTLD-tau. However, the relationship between
	some of these clinical diagnoses and specific pathologies is not
	so clear cut. In addition, the clinical diagnosis of bvFTD does not
	have a strong relationship to any FTLD subtype or specific pathology
	and therefore remains a diagnostic challenge. Some evidence suggests
	improved clinicopathological association of bvFTD by further refining
	clinical characteristics. Unlike FTLD-tau and FTLD-TDP, FTLD-FUS
	has been less well characterized, with only 69 cases reported. However,
	there appears to be some associations between clinical phenotypes
	and FTLD-FUS pathologies. Clinical diagnosis is therefore promising
	in predicting molecular pathology.},

	the most recent immunohistochemistry of all cases diagnosed with
	FTLD, PSP, and CBD between 1970 and 2004. The authors also reviewed
	the early clinical features for clinical diagnosis and application
	of published research criteria. RESULTS: Of 127 cases analyzed, 57
	had a pathologic diagnosis of FTLD, 49 PSP, and 21 CBD. Of these,
	38 were clinically reclassified as frontal variant frontotemporal
	dementia (FTD), 13 as progressive non-fluent aphasia (PNFA), 21 as
	CBD-like, 33 as PSP-like, and 13 with frontotemporal dementia with
	coexisting motor neuron disease (FTD-MND). The authors were unable
	to classify nine cases. All cases of FTD-MND were tau-negative and
	had pathologic evidence of motor neuron degeneration. All cases classified
	as PSP-like or CBD-like had tau-positive pathology. Of the 13 cases
	with PNFA, PSP and CBD accounted for almost 70\% of the cases, while
	FTD was almost equally divided between tau-positive and tau-negative
	diseases. CONCLUSION: Frontotemporal lobar degeneration, corticobasal
	degeneration (CBD), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) have
	overlapping clinical features. The prediction of tau-positive pathology
	from a CBD or PSP-like presentation is good, while the frontotemporal
	dementia (FTD)-motor neuron disease syndrome almost certainly predicts
	motor neuron degeneration. Surprisingly, PSP and CBD accounted for
	most cases classified as progressive non-fluent aphasia. Frontal
	variant FTD is an unpredictable disease in terms of its biochemistry.},

  abstract = {Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) can be classified as tau-positive
	(FTLD-tau) and tau-negative FTLD. The most common form of tau-negative
	FTLD is associated with neuronal inclusions that are composed of
	TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) (FTLD-TDP). Recent evidence suggests
	that FTLD-TDP can be further subdivided into at least three major
	histologic variants based on patterns of TDP-43 immunoreactive neuronal
	cytoplasmic inclusions (NCI) and dystrophic neurites (DN) in neocortex
	and hippocampus. The aim of this study was to extend the histologic
	analysis to other brain regions and to determine if there were distinct
	clinical and pathologic characteristics of the FTLD-TDP subtypes.
	Thirty-nine FTLD-TDP cases were analyzed (Mackenzie type 1 n = 24,
	Mackenzie type 2 n = 9, Mackenzie type 3 n = 6). There was a highly
	significant association between clinical syndrome and FTLD-TDP subtype,
	with progressive non-fluent aphasia associated with type 1, semantic
	dementia with type 2, and behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia
	with types 1, 2 and 3. Semi-quantitative analysis of NCI and DN demonstrated
	different patterns of involvement in cortical, subcortical and brainstem
	areas that were characteristic for each of the three types of FTLD-TDP.
	Type 1 had a mixture of NCI and DN, as well as intranuclear inclusions
	in most cases and TDP-43 pathology at all levels of the neuraxis,
	but less in brainstem than supratentorial structures. Type 2 cases
	were characterized by predominance of long, thick DN in the cortex,
	as well as numerous NCI in hippocampus, amygdala and basal ganglia,
	but virtually no NCI and only sparse DN in diencephalon and brainstem.
	Type 3 had a paucity of DN at all levels of the neuraxis and significantly
	more NCI in the hypoglossal nucleus than the other types. These findings
	extend previously described clinicopathological associations of FTLD-TDP
	subtypes and support the notion that FTLD-TDP subtypes may be distinct
	clinicopathologic disorders.},

	We propose a supervised method that incorporates a regression constraint

	is made robust against outliers by learning the distribution of the

	smoothing and independence constraint into the factorized bases,
	contiguous local regions are captured. We apply our technique to
	a synthetic dataset and structural {MRI} brain images of subjects
	with varying ages. {RNMF} finds the localized regions which are expected
	to be highly changing over age to be manifested in its significant

	An International Harmonization Project {(IHP)} was convened to discuss
	standardization of clinical trial parameters in lymphoma. An imaging
	subcommittee developed consensus recommendations based on published
	{PET} literature and the collective expertise of its members in the
	use of {PET} in lymphoma. Only recommendations subsequently endorsed
	by all {IHP} subcommittees were adopted. Recommendations {PET} after
	completion of therapy should be performed at least 3 weeks, and preferably
	at 6 to 8 weeks, after chemotherapy or chemoimmunotherapy, and 8
	to 12 weeks after radiation or chemoradiotherapy. Visual assessment
	alone is adequate for interpreting {PET} findings as positive or
	negative when assessing response after completion of therapy. Mediastinal
	blood pool activity is recommended as the reference background activity
	to define {PET} positivity for a residual mass ≥ 2 cm in greatest
	transverse diameter, regardless of its location. A smaller residual
	mass or a normal sized lymph node (ie, ≤ 1 ? 1 cm in diameter) should
	be considered positive if its activity is above that of the surrounding
	background. Specific criteria for defining {PET} positivity in the
	liver, spleen, lung, and bone marrow are also proposed. Use of attenuation-corrected
	{PET} is strongly encouraged. Use of {PET} for treatment monitoring
	during a course of therapy should only be done in a clinical trial
	or as part of a prospective registry.},

	language-related subcortical connections, such as the arcuate fasciculus
	(AF) by diffusion tensor (DT) imaging-based tractography. METHODS:
	Twenty-two patients with brain lesions adjacent to the AF in the
	frontotemporal regions of the dominant hemisphere were studied. The
	AF tractography was accomplished by placing initiation and termination
	sites (seed and target points) in the frontal and temporal regions,
	which were functionally identified by using functional magnetic resonance
	(fMR) imaging in conjunction with a verb generation task and magnetoencephalography
	(MEG) in conjunction with a reading task. The combination of fMR
	imaging and MEG data clearly demonstrated the hemispheric dominance
	of language functions, which was confirmed by an intracranial amobarbital
	test (Wada procedure). In all 22 patients, the authors were able
	to consistently visualize the AF by DT imaging-based tractography,
	using the functionally identified seed and target points and a fractional
	anisotropy value of 0.16. In two of 22 cases investigated, the functional
	information, including the results of AF tractography, fMR imaging,
	and MEG, was imported to a neuronavigation system and was validated
	by bipolar electric stimulation of the cortical and subcortical areas
	during awake surgery. The cortical stimulation to the gyrus that
	included the area of activation identified in fMR imaging with the
	language task evoked speech arrest, while the subcortical stimulation
	close to the AF reproducibly caused paranomia without speech arrest.
	Postoperative AF tractography showed that the distances between the
	stimulus points and the AF were within 6 mm. CONCLUSIONS: The combination
	of these techniques facilitated accurate identification of the location
	of the AF and verification of the language fibers.},

	image alignment. Standard approaches in the literature align DTI
	data by registering the corresponding scalar-valued fractional anisotropy
	(FA) maps. We propose instead a DTI registration algorithm that leverages
	full tensor information to drive improved alignment. This proposed
	pipeline is evaluated against the standard FA-based approach using
	a DTI dataset from an ongoing study of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
	The dataset consists of subjects scanned at two time points and at
	each time point the DTI acquisition consists of two back-to-back
	repeats in the same scanning session. The repeated scans allow us
	to evaluate the specificity of each pipeline, using a test-retest
	design, and assess precision, using bootstrap-based method. The results
	show that the tensor-based pipeline achieves both higher specificity
	and precision than the standard FA-based approach. Tensor-based registration
	for longitudinal processing of DTI data in clinical studies may be
	of particular value in studies assessing disease progression.},

  abstract = {Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the most common causes of
	long-term disability. Despite the importance of identifying neuropathology
	in individuals with chronic TBI, methodological challenges posed
	at the stage of inter-subject image registration have hampered previous
	voxel-based MRI studies from providing a clear pattern of structural
	atrophy after TBI. We used a novel symmetric diffeomorphic image
	normalization method to conduct a tensor-based morphometry (TBM)
	study of TBI. The key advantage of this method is that it simultaneously
	estimates an optimal template brain and topology preserving deformations
	between this template and individual subject brains. Detailed patterns
	of atrophies are then revealed by statistically contrasting control
	and subject deformations to the template space. Participants were
	29 survivors of TBI and 20 control subjects who were matched in terms
	of age, gender, education, and ethnicity. Localized volume losses
	were found most prominently in white matter regions and the subcortical
	nuclei including the thalamus, the midbrain, the corpus callosum,
	the mid- and posterior cingulate cortices, and the caudate. Significant
	voxel-wise volume loss clusters were also detected in the cerebellum
	and the frontal/temporal neocortices. Volume enlargements were identified
	largely in ventricular regions. A similar pattern of results was
	observed in a subgroup analysis where we restricted our analysis
	to the 17 TBI participants who had no macroscopic focal lesions (total
	lesion volume >1.5 cm(3)). The current study confirms, extends, and
	partly challenges previous structural MRI studies in chronic TBI.
	By demonstrating that a large deformation image registration technique
	can be successfully combined with TBM to identify TBI-induced diffuse
	structural changes with greater precision, our approach is expected
	to increase the sensitivity of future studies examining brain-behavior
	relationships in the TBI population.},

	may reflect alterations of brain structure and function after traumatic

	including measurement in relative rather than absolute units, use
	of crude spatial registration methods, exclusion of subjects with
	substantial focal lesions, and exposure to ionizing radiation, which
	limits repeated assessments. This study aimed to overcome those obstacles
	by measuring absolute CBF with an arterial spin labeling perfusion
	fMRI technique, and using an image preprocessing protocol that is
	optimized for brains with mixed diffuse and focal injuries characteristic
	of moderate and severe TBI. Resting state CBF was quantified in 27
	individuals with moderate to severe TBI in the chronic stage, and
	22 demographically matched healthy controls. In addition to global
	CBF reductions in the TBI subjects, more prominent regional hypoperfusion
	was found in the posterior cingulate cortices, the thalami, and multiple
	locations in the frontal cortices. Diffuse injury, as assessed by
	tensor-based morphometry, was mainly associated with reduced CBF
	in the posterior cingulate cortices and the thalami, where the greatest
	volume losses were detected. Hypoperfusion in superior and middle
	frontal cortices, in contrast, was associated with focal lesions.
	These results suggest that structural lesions, both focal and diffuse,
	are the main contributors to the absolute CBF alterations seen in
	chronic TBI, and that CBF may serve as a tool to assess functioning
	neuronal volume. We also speculate that resting reductions in posterior
	cingulate perfusion may reflect alterations in the default-mode network,
	and may contribute to the attentional deficits common in TBI.},

	of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) remains uncertain; while they may
	be supportive of a diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia, they are
	not mandatory. Our aim was to assess patterns of lobar atrophy in
	a large sample of clinically defined, prospectively studied, patients
	using a magnetic resonance image ({M}{R}{I}) rating scale, to (1)
	determine whether imaging findings warrant a more prominent position
	in FTD diagnosis and (2) correlate the extent of lobar atrophy with
	clinical data. METHODS: We adapted a recently devised post mortem
	rating scale for FTD to rate lobar atrophy on {M}{R}{I} scans. The
	areas rated included the frontal cortex and both anterior and posterior
	temporal regions bilaterally. All available brain scans from all
	patients seen in the Cambridge Dementia Clinic (n = 258) diagnosed
	as having FTD, together with controls (n = 20), were used to assess
	the reliability of the method. A subset of these (n = 121) were used
	for clinico-anatomic analysis. RESULTS: The scale proved quick and
	reliable (intra-, inter-rater k = 0.80, 0.67). {M}{R}{I} scans were
	abnormal in the majority of patients (75\%), with focal atrophy present
	in 100\% of semantic dementia (SD) patients. By contrast, nearly
	half (47\%) of the patients with clinical behavioural variant FTD
	had scans within the normal range. Behavioural cases with normal
	scans generally had fewer cognitive deficits and milder functional
	impairment than those with abnormal scans, yet displayed a clinically
	indistinguishable behavioural syndrome. They were not, however, simply
	at an earlier stage of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: {M}{R}{I} findings
	should form part of the diagnostic criteria for SD; the absence of
	atrophy on {M}{R}{I} in many behavioural cases raises the prospect
	that the behavioural syndrome of FTD is not specific for patients
	with a neurodegenerative disease.},

  abstract = {All fields of neuroscience that employ brain imaging need to communicate
	their results with reference to anatomical regions. In particular,
	comparative morphometry and group analysis of functional and physiological
	data require coregistration of brains to establish correspondences
	across brain structures. It is well established that linear registration
	of one brain to another is inadequate for aligning brain structures,
	so numerous algorithms have emerged to nonlinearly register brains
	to one another. This study is the largest evaluation of nonlinear
	deformation algorithms applied to brain image registration ever conducted.
	Fourteen algorithms from laboratories around the world are evaluated
	using 8 different error measures. More than 45,000 registrations
	between 80 manually labeled brains were performed by algorithms including:
	AIR, ANIMAL, ART, Diffeomorphic Demons, FNIRT, IRTK, JRD-fluid, ROMEO,
	SICLE, SyN, and four different SPM5 algorithms ("SPM2-type" and regular
	Normalization, Unified Segmentation, and the DARTEL Toolbox). All
	of these registrations were preceded by linear registration between
	the same image pairs using FLIRT. One of the most significant findings
	of this study is that the relative performances of the registration
	methods under comparison appear to be little affected by the choice
	of subject population, labeling protocol, and type of overlap measure.
	This is important because it suggests that the findings are generalizable
	to new subject populations that are labeled or evaluated using different
	labeling protocols. Furthermore, we ranked the 14 methods according
	to three completely independent analyses (permutation tests, one-way
	ANOVA tests, and indifference-zone ranking) and derived three almost
	identical top rankings of the methods. ART, SyN, IRTK, and SPM's
	DARTEL Toolbox gave the best results according to overlap and distance
	measures, with ART and SyN delivering the most consistently high
	accuracy across subjects and label sets. Updates will be published
	on the http://www.mindboggle.info/papers/ website.},

	of fully automated nonlinear deformation methods applied to brain
	image registration was restricted to volume-based methods. The present
	study is the first that directly compares some of the most accurate
	of these volume registration methods with surface registration methods,
	as well as the first study to compare registrations of whole-head
	and brain-only (de-skulled) images. We used permutation tests to
	compare the overlap or Hausdorff distance performance for more than
	16,000 registrations between 80 manually labeled brain images. We
	compared every combination of volume-based and surface-based labels,
	registration, and evaluation. Our primary findings are the following:
	1. de-skulling aids volume registration methods; 2. custom-made optimal
	average templates improve registration over direct pairwise registration;
	and 3. resampling volume labels on surfaces or converting surface
	labels to volumes introduces distortions that preclude a fair comparison
	between the highest ranking volume and surface registration methods
	using present resampling methods. From the results of this study,
	we recommend constructing a custom template from a limited sample
	drawn from the same or a similar representative population, using
	the same algorithm used for registering brains to the template.},

  abstract = {Huntington's disease is caused by a known genetic mutation and so
	potentially can be diagnosed many years before the onset of symptoms.
	Neuropathological changes have been found in both striatum and frontal
	cortex in the pre-symptomatic stage. Disruption of cortico-striatal
	white matter fibre tracts is therefore likely to contribute to the
	first clinical signs of the disease. We analysed diffusion tensor
	MR image (DTI) data from 25 pre-symptomatic gene carriers (PSCs)
	and 20 matched controls using a multivariate support vector machine
	to identify patterns of changes in fractional anisotropy (FA). In
	addition, we performed probabilistic fibre tracking to detect changes
	in 'streamlines' connecting frontal cortex to striatum. We found
	a pattern of structural brain changes that includes putamen bilaterally
	as well as anterior parts of the corpus callosum. This pattern was
	sufficiently specific to enable us to correctly classify 82\% of
	scans as coming from a PSC or control subject. Fibre tracking revealed
	a reduction of frontal cortico-fugal streamlines reaching the body
	of the caudate in PSCs compared to controls. In the left hemispheres
	of PSCs we found a negative correlation between years to estimated
	disease onset and streamlines from frontal cortex to body of caudate.
	A large proportion of the fibres to the caudate body originate from
	the frontal eye fields, which play an important role in the control
	of voluntary saccades. This type of saccade is specifically impaired
	in PSCs and is an early clinical sign of motor abnormalities. A correlation
	analysis in 14 PSCs revealed that subjects with greater impairment
	of voluntary-guided saccades had fewer fibre tracking streamlines
	connecting the frontal cortex and caudate body. Our findings suggest
	a specific patho-physiological basis for these symptoms by indicating
	selective vulnerability of the associated white matter tracts.},

	disease mutation carriers (MC) provides an opportunity to detect
	changes that pre-date symptoms or clinical diagnosis. We used automated
	cortical thickness (CTh) measurement to compare the grey matter of
	such a group with cognitively normal controls. METHODS: 9 presymptomatic
	mutation carriers (4 PSEN1, 5 APP) and 25 healthy, age and sex-matched
	controls underwent longitudinal volumetric MRI brain imaging. CTh
	measurement was performed across the whole brain using a validated,
	automated technique. Four regions of interest (ROI) (entorhinal cortex
	(ERC), parahippocampal gyrus (PHG), posterior cingulate cortex and
	precuneus) and two control regions (paracentral and pericalcarine)
	were selected on the basis of imaging data in existing Alzheimer's
	disease (AD) literature. Linear mixed models were used to describe
	normal ageing in controls and the extent to which mean CTh in cases
	differed from controls according to time since clinical diagnosis,
	adjusting for normal ageing. RESULTS: An accelerating decline in
	CTh was observed across all ROI in the MC group. No such decline
	was demonstrated in the control regions for the MC group. Relative
	to controls, and adjusting for normal ageing, there was evidence
	(p=0.05, one-sided test) of lower CTh in the posterior cingulate
	up to 1.8 years prior to diagnosis and in the precuneus up to 4.1
	years prior to diagnosis in the MC group. DISCUSSION: Automated CTh
	analysis is a relatively practical, rapid and effective technique
	for assessing subtle structural change in AD. There is evidence that
	cortical thickness is reduced in mutation carriers a number of years
	prior to clinical diagnosis.},

	and Furniture). The neuropsychological tests were factor analyzed
	to extract two components of CPS: psychomotor (PM) and psychophysical
	(PP). MRI-based indices of cerebral integrity included three cortical
	measurements per hemisphere (GM thickness, intergyral and sulcal
	spans) and two subcortical indices (fractional anisotropy (FA), measured
	using track-based spatial statistics (TBSS), and the volume of hyperintense
	WM (HWM)). MRS indices included levels of choline-containing compounds
	(GPC+PC), phosphocreatine plus creatine (PCr+Cr), and N-acetylaspartate
	(NAA), measured bilaterally in the frontal WM bundles. A substantial
	fraction of the variance in the PM-CPS (58\%) was attributed to atrophic
	changes in frontal WM, observed as increases in sulcal span, declines
	in FA values and reductions in concentrations of NAA and choline-containing
	compounds. A smaller proportion (20\%) of variance in the PP-CPS
	could be explained by bilateral increases in frontal sulcal span
	and increases in HWM volumes.},

  abstract = {Relationships between structural MRI-based markers of declining cerebral
	integrity, and regional PET measurements of (18)FDG uptake have not
	been studied well in normal aging. In this manuscript we relate changes
	in cerebral morphology to regional cerebral glucose uptake for 14
	major cortical areas in 19 healthy older individuals (age 59-92 years).
	Measurements of cerebral integrity included gray matter (GM) thickness,
	sulcal and intergyral spans, fractional anisotropy (FA) of water
	diffusion and volume of hyperintense WM (HWM) lesions. (18)FDG-PET
	measurements were converted to standard uptake values and corrected
	for partial volume artifact. Following this, cortical FDG uptake
	was significantly correlated with several indices of WM integrity
	that we previously observed to be sensitive to cognitive decline
	in executive function, including intergyral span and HWM volumes.
	Our findings suggest that the age-related decline in white matter
	integrity, observed as increases in HWM lesions, intergyral spans
	and reduction in FA, correlated with a decline in the global and
	regional cerebral glucose uptake. Our findings support the emerging
	consensus that WM integrity indices are sensitive predictors of declining
	cerebral health in normal aging. Specifically, age-related WM degradation
	in the thinly myelinated association tracts appears to track the
	decreases in global and regional rates of glucose uptake.},

	biochemical, radiological, and pathological characteristics of 49
	affected (23 male, 26 female) individuals from four unrelated United
	States families. Among these affected individuals 90\% have myopathy,
	43\% have Paget disease of bone, and 37\% have premature frontotemporal
	dementia. EMG shows myopathic changes and muscle biopsy reveals nonspecific
	myopathic changes or blue-rimmed vacuoles. After candidate loci were
	excluded, a genome-wide screen in the large Illinois family showed
	linkage to chromosome 9 (maximum LOD score 3.64 with marker D9S301).
	Linkage analysis with a high density of chromosome 9 markers generated
	a maximum two-point LOD score of 9.29 for D9S1791, with a maximum
	multipoint LOD score of 12.24 between D9S304 and D9S1788. Subsequent
	evaluation of three additional families demonstrating similar clinical
	characteristics confirmed this locus, refined the critical region,
	and further delineated clinical features of this unique disorder.
	Hence, autosomal dominant inclusion body myopathy (HIBM), Paget disease
	of bone (PDB), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) localizes to a 1.08-6.46

  abstract = {Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) with mutations in the tau
	gene (MAPT) causes familial frontotemporal dementia with tau pathology.
	Many of these mutations result in morphological phenotypes resembling
	sporadic tauopathies, although, to date, no such cases mimicking
	argyrophilic grain disease (AgD) have been documented. We now present
	a case with a novel S305I MAPT mutation and a morphological phenotype
	showing resemblance to AgD. At the age of 39, the patient developed
	behavioural and personality changes and lack of verbal fluency with
	later poor performance on naming tasks and rigidity in the extremities.
	After a short disease course of 1.5 years, the patient died. A unique
	neuropathological phenotype with neuronal diffuse cytoplasmic tau
	immunoreactivity, oligodendroglial-coiled bodies, argyrophilic grains,
	and non-argyrophilic, but tau-immunopositive and ubiquitin-immunonegative
	pre-grains were observed, whereas classical neurofibrillary tangles,
	Pick bodies, and neuritic plaques were absent. The tau-positive abnormal
	structures were composed only of 4R-tau isoforms and, ultrastructurally,
	straight filaments. Neuronal loss was greatest in the medial temporal
	cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala. These pathological features resemble
	AgD. The novel S305I substitution has a strong effect on MAPT exon
	10 splicing, thereby causing a striking increase in 4R-tau isoforms.
	Our observation not only widens the phenotypic spectrum of FTLD with
	MAPT mutation but also underpins the notion that the predominance
	of similar neuropathological findings in sporadic AgD cases may be
	viewed as features of a distinct disease entity.},

  abstract = {Loss-of-function mutations in the multifunctional growth factor progranulin
	(GRN) cause frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) with TDP-43
	protein accumulation. Nuclear TDP-43 protein with key roles in RNA
	metabolism is also aggregated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS),
	suggesting that ALS and FTLD constitute a broad disease continuum.
	However, the fact that mutations in GRN are associated with FTLD,
	while mutations in TDP-43 cause a preferential loss of motor neurons
	resulting in ALS-end of the disease spectrum, suggests involvement
	of both cell-autonomous and non-autonomous mechanisms. Studies on
	animal models and in vitro studies have been instrumental in understanding
	the link between GRN and TDP-43 and also their role in neurodegeneration.
	For instance, in mouse models, allelic deficiencies of Grn do not
	recapitulate human pathology of TDP-43 brain accumulations, but embryonic
	neurons derived from these mice do show abnormal TDP-43 accumulation
	after additional cellular challenges, suggesting that TDP-43 changes
	observed in GRN mutation carriers might also relate to stress. Recent
	results have shown that the dual action of GRN in growth modulation
	and inflammation could be due to its negative regulation of TNF-?
	signaling. In addition, GRN also interacts with sortilin and is endocytosed,
	thereby regulating its own levels and possibly also modulating the
	turnover of other proteins including that of TDP-43. Accumulating
	evidence suggests that TDP-43 abnormal cellular aggregation causes
	a possible gain of function, also suggested by recently constructed
	mouse models of TDP-43 proteinopathy; however, it would be inconvincible
	that sequestration of physiological TDP-43 within cellular aggregates
	observed in patients would be innocuous for disease pathogenesis.
	This review discusses some of these data on the possible link between
	GRN and TDP-43 as well as mechanisms involved in TDP-43-led neurodegeneration.
	Continued multitiered efforts on genetic, cell biological, and animal
	modeling approaches would prove crucial in finding a cure for GRN-related

  abstract = {The genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is not well
	understood. Finland is a well suited location for a genome-wide association
	study of ALS because the incidence of the disease is one of the highest
	in the world, and because the genetic homogeneity of the Finnish
	population enhances the ability to detect risk loci. We aimed to
	identify genetic risk factors for ALS in the Finnish population.We
	did a genome-wide association study of Finnish patients with ALS
	and control individuals by use of Illumina genome-wide genotyping
	arrays. DNA was collected from patients who attended an ALS specialty
	clinic that receives referrals from neurologists throughout Finland.
	Control samples were from a population-based study of elderly Finnish
	individuals. Patients known to carry D90A alleles of the SOD1 gene
	(n=40) were included in the final analysis as positive controls to
	assess whether our genome-wide association study was able to detect
	an association signal at this locus.We obtained samples from 442
	patients with ALS and 521 control individuals. After quality control
	filters were applied, 318?167 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
	from 405 people with ALS and 497 control individuals were available
	for analysis. We identified two association peaks that exceeded genome-wide
	significance. One was located on chromosome 21q22 (rs13048019, p=2·58?10(-8)),
	which corresponds to the autosomal recessive D90A allele of the SOD1
	gene. The other was detected in a 232 kb block of linkage disequilibrium
	(rs3849942, p=9·11?10(-11)) in a region of chromosome 9p that was
	previously identified in linkage studies of families with ALS. Within
	this region, we defined a 42-SNP haplotype that was associated with
	significantly increased risk of ALS (p=7·47?10(-33) when people with
	familial ALS were compared with controls, odds ratio 21·0, 95\% CI
	11·2-39·1) and which overlapped with an association locus recently
	reported for frontotemporal dementia. For the 93 patients with familial
	ALS, the population attributable risk for the chromosome 9p21 locus
	was 37·9\% (95\% CI 27·7-48·1) and that for D90A homozygosity was
	25·5\% (16·9-34·1).The chromosome 9p21 locus is a major cause of
	familial ALS in the Finnish population. Our data suggest the presence
	of a founder mutation for chromosome 9p21-linked ALS. Furthermore,
	the overlap with the risk haplotype recently reported for frontotemporal
	dementia provides further evidence of a shared genetic cause for
	these two neurodegenerative diseases.National Institutes of Health

  abstract = {Neuronal intermediate filament inclusion disease and atypical frontotemporal
	lobar degeneration are rare diseases characterized by ubiquitin-positive
	inclusions lacking transactive response DNA-binding protein-43 and
	tau. Recently, mutations in the fused in sarcoma gene have been shown
	to cause familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and fused in sarcoma-positive
	neuronal inclusions have subsequently been demonstrated in neuronal
	intermediate filament inclusion disease and atypical frontotemporal
	lobar degeneration with ubiquitinated inclusions. Here we provide
	clinical, imaging, morphological findings, as well as genetic and
	biochemical data in 14 fused in sarcoma proteinopathy cases. In this
	cohort, the age of onset was variable but included cases of young-onset
	disease. Patients with atypical frontotemporal lobar degeneration
	with ubiquitinated inclusions all presented with behavioural variant
	frontotemporal dementia, while the clinical presentation in neuronal
	intermediate filament inclusion disease was more heterogeneous, including
	cases with motor neuron disease and extrapyramidal syndromes. Neuroimaging
	revealed atrophy of the frontal and anterior temporal lobes as well
	as the caudate in the cases with atypical frontotemporal lobar degeneration
	with ubiquitinated inclusions, but was more heterogeneous in the
	cases with neuronal intermediate filament inclusion disease, often
	being normal to visual inspection early on in the disease. The distribution
	and severity of fused in sarcoma-positive neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions,
	neuronal intranuclear inclusions and neurites were recorded and fused
	in sarcoma was biochemically analysed in both subgroups. Fused in
	sarcoma-positive neuronal cytoplasmic and intranuclear inclusions
	were found in the hippocampal granule cell layer in variable numbers.
	Cortical fused in sarcoma-positive neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions
	were often 'Pick body-like' in neuronal intermediate filament inclusion
	disease, and annular and crescent-shaped inclusions were seen in
	both conditions. Motor neurons contained variable numbers of compact,
	granular or skein-like cytoplasmic inclusions in all fused in sarcoma-positive
	cases in which brainstem and spinal cord motor neurons were available
	for study (five and four cases, respectively). No fused in sarcoma
	mutations were found in any cases. Biochemically, two major fused
	in sarcoma species were found and shown to be more insoluble in the
	atypical frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitinated inclusions
	subgroup compared with neuronal intermediate filament inclusion disease.
	There is considerable overlap and also significant differences in
	fused in sarcoma-positive pathology between the two subgroups, suggesting
	they may represent a spectrum of the same disease. The co-existence
	of fused in sarcoma-positive inclusions in both motor neurons and
	extramotor cerebral structures is a characteristic finding in sporadic
	fused in sarcoma proteinopathies, indicating a multisystem disorder.},

  abstract = {Frontotemporal dementia associated with motor neuron disease (FTD-MND)
	is a rare neurodegenerative disorder that may be inherited by autosomal
	dominant trait. No major gene has been identified but a locus was
	mapped on chromosome 9 (9p21.3-p13.3).Ten French families with FTD-MND
	were tested for linkage to the 9p21.3-p13.3 region. We report extensive
	mutation screening in 9p-linked families and their clinical characteristics.We
	identified six new families with evidence for linkage to the chromosome
	9p. Cumulative multipoint LOD score values were positive between
	markers D9S1121 and D9S301, reaching a peak of 8.0 at marker D9S248.
	Haplotype reconstruction defined the telomeric boundary at marker
	AFM218xg11, slightly narrowing the candidate interval. We found no
	disease-causing mutations by sequencing 29 candidate genes including
	IFT74 and no copy number variations in the 9p region. The mean age
	at onset was 57.9 +/- 10.3 years (range, 41-84), with wide heterogeneity
	within and among families suggesting age-dependant penetrance. The
	patients presented isolated FTD (32\%), isolated MND (29\%), or both
	disorders (39\%). The general characteristics of the disease did
	not differ, except for an older age at onset and shorter disease
	duration in the 9p-linked compared to nonlinked families. TDP-43-positive
	neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions were found in cortex and spinal cord
	in 3 patients.This study increases the number of 9p-linked families
	now reported and shows that this locus may have a major effect on
	frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and motor neuron disease (MND). Considering
	our results, the causative gene might be implicated in at least 60\%
	of the families with FTD-MND disorder.},

	of mutation carriers. Eighteen mutations, seven novel were found
	in 24 families including 32 symptomatic mutation carriers. No copy
	number variation was found. The phenotypes associated with GRN mutations
	vary greatly: 20/32 (63\%) carriers had fvFTD, the other (12/32,
	37\%) had clinical diagnoses of PPA, CBDS, Lewy body dementia or
	Alzheimer's disease. Parkinsonism developed in 13/32 (41\%), visual
	hallucinations in 8/32 (25\%) and motor apraxia in 5/21 (24\%). Constructional
	disorders were present in 10/21 (48\%). Episodic memory disorders
	were frequent (16/18, 89\%), consistent with hippocampal amnestic
	syndrome in 5/18 (28\%). Hypoperfusion was observed in the hippocampus,
	parietal lobe and posterior cingulate gyrus, as well as the frontotemporal
	cortices. The frequency of mutations according to phenotype was 5.7\%
	(20/352) in fvFTD, 17.9\% (19/106) in familial forms, 4.4\% in PPA
	(3/68), 3.3\% in CBDS (1/30). Hallucinations, apraxia and amnestic
	syndrome may help differentiate GRN mutation carriers from others
	FTD patients. Variable phenotypes and neuropsychological profiles,
	as well as brain perfusion profiles associated with GRN mutations
	may reflect different patterns of neurodegeneration. Since all the
	mutations cause a progranulin haploinsufficiency, additional factors
	probably explain the variable clinical presentation of the disease.},

	rooted in the powerful concept that during their random, diffusion-driven
	displacements molecules probe tissue structure at a microscopic scale

	process, molecular mobility in tissues may be anisotropic, as in
	brain white matter. With diffusion tensor imaging {(DTI)}, diffusion
	anisotropy effects can be fully extracted, characterized, and exploited,
	providing even more exquisite details on tissue microstructure. The
	most advanced application is certainly that of fiber tracking in
	the brain, which, in combination with functional {MRI}, might open
	a window on the important issue of connectivity. {DTI} has also been
	used to demonstrate subtle abnormalities in a variety of diseases
	(including stroke, multiple sclerosis, dyslexia, and schizophrenia)
	and is currently becoming part of many routine clinical protocols.
	The aim of this article is to review the concepts behind {DTI} and

	Non-negative matrix factorization is distinguished from the other
	methods by its use of non-negativity constraints. These constraints
	lead to a parts-based representation because they allow only additive,
	not subtractive, combinations. When non-negative matrix factorization
	is implemented as a neural network, parts-based representations emerge
	by virtue of two properties: the firing rates of neurons are never

  abstract = {Brain imaging is increasingly recognised as an intermediate phenotype
	to understand the complex path between genetics and behavioural or
	clinical phenotypes. In this context, a first goal is to propose
	methods to identify the part of genetic variability that explains
	some neuroimaging variability. Classical univariate approaches often
	ignore the potential joint effects that may exist between genes or
	the potential covariations between brain regions. In this paper,
	we propose instead to investigate an exploratory multivariate method
	in order to identify a set of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs)
	covarying with a set of neuroimaging phenotypes derived from functional
	Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). Recently, Partial Least Squares
	(PLS) regression or Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) have been
	proposed to analyse DNA and transcriptomics. Here, we propose to
	transpose this idea to the DNA vs. imaging context. However, in very
	high-dimensional settings like in imaging genetics studies, such
	multivariate methods may encounter overfitting issues. Thus we investigate
	the use of different strategies of regularisation and dimension reduction
	techniques combined with PLS or CCA to face the very high dimensionality
	of imaging genetics studies. We propose a comparison study of the
	different strategies on a simulated dataset first and then on a real
	dataset composed of 94 subjects, around 600,000 SNPs and 34 functional
	MRI lateralisation indexes computed from reading and speech comprehension
	contrast maps. We estimate the generalisability of the multivariate
	association with a cross-validation scheme and demonstrate the significance
	of this link, using a permutation procedure. Univariate selection
	appears to be necessary to reduce the dimensionality. However, the
	significant association uncovered by this two-step approach combining
	univariate filtering and L1-regularised PLS suggests that discovering
	meaningful genetic associations calls for a multivariate approach.},

  abstract = {We address the problem of the segmentation of cerebral white matter
	structures from diffusion tensor images {(DTI).} A {DTI} produces,
	from a set of diffusion-weighted {MR} images, tensor-valued images
	where each voxel is assigned with a 3 x 3 symmetric, positive-definite
	matrix. This second order tensor is simply the covariance matrix
	of a local Gaussian process, with zero-mean, modeling the average
	motion of water molecules. As we will show in this paper, the definition
	of a dissimilarity measure and statistics between such quantities
	is a nontrivial task which must be tackled carefully. We claim and
	demonstrate that, by using the theoretically well-founded differential
	geometrical properties of the manifold of multivariate normal distributions,
	it is possible to improve the quality of the segmentation results
	obtained with other dissimilarity measures such as the Euclidean
	distance or the Kullback-Leibler divergence. The main goal of this
	paper is to prove that the choice of the probability metric, i.e.,
	the dissimilarity measure, has a deep impact on the tensor statistics
	and, hence, on the achieved results. We introduce a variational formulation,
	in the level-set framework, to estimate the optimal segmentation
	of a {DTI} according to the following hypothesis: Diffusion tensors
	exhibit a Gaussian distribution in the different partitions. We must
	also respect the geometric constraints imposed by the interfaces
	existing among the cerebral structures and detected by the gradient
	of the {DTI.} We show how to express all the statistical quantities

  abstract = {Digits backward (DB) is a widely used neuropsychological measure
	that is believed to be a simple and effective index of the capacity
	of the verbal working memory. However, its neural correlates remain
	elusive. The aim of this study is to investigate the neural correlates
	of DB in 299 healthy young adults by combining voxel-based morphometry
	(VBM) and resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) analyses.
	The VBM analysis showed positive correlations between the DB scores
	and the gray matter volumes in the right anterior superior temporal
	gyrus (STG), the right posterior STG, the left inferior frontal gyrus
	and the left Rolandic operculum, which are four critical areas in
	the auditory phonological loop of the verbal working memory. Voxel-based
	correlation analysis was then performed between the positive rsFCs
	of these four clusters and the DB scores. We found that the DB scores
	were positively correlated with the rsFCs within the salience network
	(SN), that is, between the right anterior STG, the dorsal anterior
	cingulate cortex and the right fronto-insular cortex. We also found
	that the DB scores were negatively correlated with the rsFC within
	an anti-correlation network of the SN, between the right posterior
	STG and the left posterior insula. Our findings suggest that DB performance
	is related to the structural and functional organizations of the
	brain areas that are involved in the auditory phonological loop and
	the SN.},

  abstract = {Longitudinal atlas construction plays an important role in medical
	image analysis. Given a set of longitudinal images from different
	subjects, the task of longitudinal atlas construction is to build
	an atlas sequence which can represent the trend of anatomical changes
	of the population. The major challenge for longitudinal atlas construction
	is how to effectively incorporate both the subject-specific information
	and population information to build the unbiased atlases. In this
	paper, a novel groupwise longitudinal atlas construction framework
	is proposed to address this challenge, and the main contributions
	of the proposed framework lie in the following aspects: (1) The subject-specific
	longitudinal information is captured by building the growth model
	for each subject. (2) The longitudinal atlas sequence is constructed
	by performing groupwise registration among all the subject image
	sequences, and only one transformation is needed to transform each
	subject's image sequence to the atlas space. The constructed longitudinal
	atlases are unbiased and no explicit template is assumed. (3) The
	proposed method is general, where the number of longitudinal images
	of each subject and the time points at which they are taken can be
	different. The proposed method is extensively evaluated on two longitudinal
	databases, namely the BLSA and ADNI databases, to construct the longitudinal
	atlas sequence. It is also compared with a state-of-the-art longitudinal
	atlas construction algorithm based on kernel regression on the temporal
	domain. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
	consistently achieves higher registration accuracies and more consistent
	spatial-temporal correspondences than the compared method on both
	databases.},

  abstract = {Identification of spatiotemporal interactions within/between neuron
	populations is critical for detection and characterization of large-scale
	neuronal interactions underlying perception, cognition, and behavior.
	Univariate analysis has been employed successfully in many neuroimaging
	studies. However, univariate analysis does not explicitly test for
	interactions between distributed areas of activity and is not sensitive
	to distributed responses across the brain. Multivariate analysis
	can explicitly test for multiple statistical models, including the
	designed paradigm, and allows for spatial and temporal model detection.
	Here, we investigate multivariate analysis approaches that take into
	consideration the 4D (time and space) covariance structure of the
	data. Principal component analysis (PCA) and independent component
	analysis (ICA) are two popular multivariate approaches with distinct
	mathematical constraints. Common difficulties in using these two
	different decompositions include the following: classification of
	the revealed components (task-related signal versus noise), overall
	signal-to-noise sensitivity, and the relatively low computational
	efficiency (multivariate analysis requires the entire raw data set
	and more time for model identification analysis). Using both Monte
	Carlo simulations and empirical data, we derived and tested the generalized
	partial least squares (gPLS) framework, which can incorporate both
	PCA and ICA decompositions with computational efficiency. The gPLS
	method explicitly incorporates the experimental design to simplify
	the identification of characteristic spatiotemporal patterns. We
	performed parametric modeling studies of a blocked-design experiment
	under various conditions, including background noise distribution,
	sampling rate, and hemodynamic response delay. We used a randomized
	grouping approach to manipulate the degrees of freedom of PCA and
	ICA in gPLS to characterize both paradigm coherent and transient
	brain responses. Simulation data suggest that in the gPLS framework,
	PCA mostly outperforms ICA as measured by the receiver operating
	curves (ROCs) in SNR from 0.01 to 100, the hemodynamic response delays
	from 0 to 3 TR in fMRI, background noise models of Guassian, sub-Gaussian,
	and super-Gaussian distributions and the number of observations from
	5, 10, to 20 in each block of a six-block experiment. Further, due
	to selective averaging, the gPLS method performs robustly in low
	signal-to-noise ratio (<1) experiments. We also tested PCA and ICA
	using PLS in a simulated event-related fMRI data to show their similar
	detection. Finally, we tested our gPLS approach on empirical fMRI
	motor data. Using the randomized grouping method, we are able to
	identify both transient responses and consistent paradigm/model coherent
	components in the 10-epoch block design motor fMRI experiment. Overall,
	studies of synthetic and empirical data suggest that PLS analysis,
	using PCA decomposition, provides a stable and powerful tool for
	exploration of fMRI/behavior data.},

  title = {An augmented Lagrangian approach for sparse principal component analysis},
  journal = {Mathematical Programming},
  pages = {1--45},
  abstract = {Principal component analysis {(PCA)} is a widely used technique for
	data analysis and dimension reduction with numerous applications
	in science and engineering. However, the standard {PCA} suffers from
	the fact that the principal components {(PCs)} are usually linear
	combinations of all the original variables, and it is thus often
	difficult to interpret the {PCs.} To alleviate this drawback, various
	sparse {PCA} approaches were proposed in the literature {(Cadima}
	and Jolliffe in J Appl Stat 22:203–214, 1995 ; {d’Aspremont} et al.
	in J Mach Learn Res 9:1269–1294, 2008 ; {d’Aspremont} et al. {SIAM}
	Rev 49:434–448, 2007 ; Jolliffe in J Appl Stat 22:29–35, 1995 ; Journée
	et al. in J Mach Learn Res 11:517–553, 2010 ; Jolliffe et al. in

	in neural information processing systems 18:915–922, {MIT} Press,
	Cambridge, 2006 ; Shen and Huang in J Multivar Anal 99(6):1015–1034,
	2008 ; Zou et al. in J Comput Graph Stat 15(2):265–286, 2006 ). Despite
	success in achieving sparsity, some important properties enjoyed
	by the standard {PCA} are lost in these methods such as uncorrelation
	of {PCs} and orthogonality of loading vectors. Also, the total explained
	variance that they attempt to maximize can be too optimistic. In
	this paper we propose a new formulation for sparse {PCA}, aiming
	at finding sparse and nearly uncorrelated {PCs} with orthogonal loading
	vectors while explaining as much of the total variance as possible.
	We also develop a novel augmented Lagrangian method for solving a
	class of nonsmooth constrained optimization problems, which is well
	suited for our formulation of sparse {PCA.} We show that it converges
	to a feasible point, and moreover under some regularity assumptions,
	it converges to a stationary point. Additionally, we propose two
	nonmonotone gradient methods for solving the augmented Lagrangian
	subproblems, and establish their global and local convergence. Finally,
	we compare our sparse {PCA} approach with several existing methods
	on synthetic {(Zou} et al. in J Comput Graph Stat 15(2):265–286,
	2006 ), Pitprops {(Jeffers} in Appl Stat 16:225–236, 1967 ), and
	gene expression data {(Chin} et al in Cancer Cell {10:529C–541C},
	2006 ), respectively. The computational results demonstrate that
	the sparse {PCs} produced by our approach substantially outperform
	those by other methods in terms of total explained variance, correlation
	of {PCs}, and orthogonality of loading vectors. Moreover, the experiments
	on random data show that our method is capable of solving large-scale
	problems within a reasonable amount of time.},

	Linkage to chromosome 9p had been reported for pedigrees with the

	Genetic linkage and haplotype analyses, defined a critical region

  abstract = {Frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitinated inclusions (FTLD-U)
	is the most common neuropathology associated with the clinical syndrome
	of frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Recently, TDP-43 was identified
	as the ubiquitinated pathological protein in both FTLD-U and sporadic
	amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Although a number of studies have
	now confirmed that most sporadic and familial cases of FTLD-U are
	TDP-43 proteinopathies, there are exceptions. We describe six cases
	of early onset FTD with FTLD-U pathology that was negative for TDP-43,
	which we refer to as 'atypical' FTLD-U. All cases were sporadic and
	had very early onset FTD (mean age = 35 years), characterized by
	severe progressive psychobehavioural abnormalities in the absence
	of significant aphasia, cognitive-intellectual dysfunction or motor
	features. The neuropathological features were highly consistent,
	with small, round, neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions that were immunoreactive
	for ubiquitin (ub-ir), but negative for tau, alpha-synuclein, intermediate
	filaments and TDP-43. Cytoplasmic inclusions were most numerous in
	the neocortex, dentate granule cells and hippocampal pyramidal neurons.
	Ub-ir neuronal intra-nuclear inclusions were also present in neocortical
	and hippocampal neurons and had the unusual appearance of straight,
	curved or twisted filaments. We believe that these cases represent
	a new entity that is clinically and pathologically distinct from
	all currently recognized subtypes of FTLD. Moreover, the existence
	of such cases indicates that the designations of 'FTLD-U' and 'TDP-43
	proteinopathy' should not be considered to be synonymous.},

	However, in ~10\% of cases, composed of a heterogenous collection

	We recently discovered that the pathological changes in several tau/TDP-43-negative
	FTLD subtypes are immunoreactive (ir) for the fused in sarcoma (FUS)
	protein. In this study, we directly compared the pattern of FUS-ir
	pathology in cases of atypical FTLD-U (aFTLD-U, N = 10), neuronal
	intermediate filament inclusion disease (NIFID, N = 5) and basophilic
	inclusion body disease (BIBD, N = 8), to determine whether these
	are discrete entities or represent a pathological continuum. All
	cases had FUS-ir pathology in the cerebral neocortex, hippocampus
	and a similar wide range of subcortical regions. Although there was
	significant overlap, each group showed specific differences that
	distinguished them from the others. Cases of aFTLD-U consistently
	had less pathology in subcortical regions. In addition, the neuronal
	inclusions in aFTLD-U usually had a uniform, round shape, whereas
	NIFID and BIBD were characterized by a variety of inclusion morphologies.
	In all cases of aFTLD-U and NIFID, vermiform neuronal intranuclear
	inclusions (NII) were readily identified in the hippocampus and neocortex.
	In contrast, only two cases of BIBD had very rare NII in a single
	subcortical region. These findings support aFTLD-U, NIFID and BIBD
	as representing closely related, but distinct entities that share
	a common molecular pathogenesis. Although cases with overlapping
	pathology may exist, we recommend retaining the terms aFTLD-U, NIFID

  abstract = {An expanded hexanucleotide repeat in the C9ORF72 gene has recently
	been identified as a major cause of familial frontotemporal lobar
	degeneration and motor neuron disease, including cases previously
	identified as linked to chromosome 9. Here we present a detailed
	retrospective clinical, neuroimaging and histopathological analysis
	of a C9ORF72 mutation case series in relation to other forms of genetically
	determined frontotemporal lobar degeneration ascertained at a specialist
	centre. Eighteen probands (19 cases in total) were identified, representing
	35\% of frontotemporal lobar degeneration cases with identified mutations,
	36\% of cases with clinical evidence of motor neuron disease and
	7\% of the entire cohort. Thirty-three per cent of these C9ORF72
	cases had no identified relevant family history. Families showed
	wide variation in clinical onset (43-68 years) and duration (1.7-22
	years). The most common presenting syndrome (comprising a half of
	cases) was behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia, however,
	there was substantial clinical heterogeneity across the C9ORF72 mutation
	cohort. Sixty per cent of cases developed clinical features consistent
	with motor neuron disease during the period of follow-up. Anxiety
	and agitation and memory impairment were prominent features (between
	a half to two-thirds of cases), and dominant parietal dysfunction
	was also frequent. Affected individuals showed variable magnetic
	resonance imaging findings; however, relative to healthy controls,
	the group as a whole showed extensive thinning of frontal, temporal
	and parietal cortices, subcortical grey matter atrophy including
	thalamus and cerebellum and involvement of long intrahemispheric,
	commissural and corticospinal tracts. The neuroimaging profile of
	the C9ORF72 expansion was significantly more symmetrical than progranulin
	mutations with significantly less temporal lobe involvement than
	microtubule-associated protein tau mutations. Neuropathological examination
	in six cases with C9ORF72 mutation from the frontotemporal lobar
	degeneration series identified histomorphological features consistent
	with either type A or B TAR DNA-binding protein-43 deposition; however,
	p62-positive (in excess of TAR DNA-binding protein-43 positive) neuronal
	cytoplasmic inclusions in hippocampus and cerebellum were a consistent

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: INTRODUCTION: Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a common
	cause of early-onset dementia with a significant genetic component,
	as underlined by the recent identification of repeat expansions in
	the gene C9ORF72 as a major cause of FTD and motor neuron disease.
	Understanding the neurobiology and clinical phenomenology of this
	novel mutation is currently a major research focus. However, few
	data are available concerning the longitudinal evolution of this
	genetic disease. Here we present longitudinal neuropsychological
	and neuroimaging data on a cohort of patients with pathological repeat
	expansions in C9ORF72. METHODS: Following a review of the University
	College London FTD DNA database, 20 cases were retrospectively identified
	with a C9ORF72 expansion. Twelve cases had longitudinal neuropsychology
	data available and six of these cases also had longitudinal volumetric
	brain magnetic resonance imaging. Cortical and subcortical volumes
	were extracted using FreeSurfer. Rates of whole brain, hemispheric,
	cerebellar and ventricular change were calculated for each subject.
	Nonlinear fluid registration of follow-up to baseline scan was performed
	to visualise longitudinal intra-subject patterns of brain atrophy
	and ventricular expansion. RESULTS: Patients had low average verbal
	and performance IQ at baseline that became impaired (< 5th percentile)
	at follow-up. In particular, visual memory, naming and dominant parietal
	skills all showed deterioration. Mean rates of whole brain atrophy
	(1.4\%/year) and ventricular expansion (3.2 ml/year) were substantially
	greater in patients with the C9ORF72 mutation than in healthy controls;
	atrophy was symmetrical between the cerebral hemispheres within the
	C9ORF72 mutation group. The thalamus and cerebellum showed significant
	atrophy whereas no cortical areas were preferentially affected. Longitudinal
	fluid imaging in individual patients demonstrated heterogeneous patterns
	of progressive volume loss; however, ventricular expansion and cerebellar
	volume loss were consistent findings. CONCLUSION: Disease evolution
	in C9ORF72-associated FTD is linked neuropsychologically with increasing
	involvement of parietal and amnestic functions, and neuroanatomically
	with rather diffuse and variable cortical and central atrophy but
	more consistent involvement of the cerebellum and thalamus. These
	longitudinal profiles are consistent with disease spread within a
	distributed subcortical network and demonstrate the feasibility of
	longitudinal biomarkers for tracking the evolution of the C9ORF72
	mutation phenotype.},

	The FBI is a standardized behavioral questionnaire useful in the
	diagnosis and quantification of the personality and behavior disorder
	{F}{T}{D}. METHOD: Patients who had three consecutive yearly assessments
	with the FBI were selected, 12 with the behavioral variant of {F}{T}{D}
	({F}{T}{D}-bv) and 14 with Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA). RESULTS:
	FBI scores rose as the disease progressed in both the {F}{T}{D}-bv
	and PPA groups over the 3 years of testing. Initial mean FBI scores
	of the {F}{T}{D}-bv group were above the cutoff for {F}{T}{D} as
	established for this diagnosis with previous standardization. By
	the third year, the mean FBI score of PPA patients was also above
	the established cutoff for {F}{T}{D}. CONCLUSIONS: The outcome of
	the study demonstrates that the FBI is sensitive to changes in behavior
	and personality in both variants of {F}{T}{D}. The FBI can be used
	to describe the evolution of symptoms and the course of the illness
	of Pick complex patients who present initially with {F}{T}{D}-bv

	convolved time-varying EEG spectrum, S, is intrinsically multidimensional
	in space, frequency, and time motivated us to use multiway Partial
	Least-Squares (N-PLS) analysis to decompose EEG (independent variable)
	and fMRI (dependent variable) data uniquely as a sum of "atoms".
	Each EEG atom is the outer product of spatial, spectral, and temporal
	signatures and each fMRI atom the product of spatial and temporal
	signatures. The decomposition was constrained to maximize the covariance
	between corresponding temporal signatures of the EEG and fMRI. On
	all data sets, three components whose spectral peaks were in the
	theta, alpha, and gamma bands appeared; only the alpha atom had a
	significant temporal correlation with the fMRI signal. The spatial
	distribution of the alpha-band atom included parieto-occipital cortex,
	thalamus, and insula, and corresponded closely to that reported by
	Goldman et al. [NeuroReport 13(18) (2002) 2487] using a more conventional
	analysis. The source reconstruction from EEG spatial signature showed
	only the parieto-occipital sources. We interpret these results to
	indicate that some electrical sources may be intrinsically invisible
	to scalp EEG, yet may be revealed through conjoint analysis of EEG
	and fMRI data. These results may also expose brain regions that participate
	in the control of brain rhythms but may not themselves be generators.
	As of yet, no single neuroimaging method offers the optimal combination
	of spatial and temporal resolution; fusing fMRI and EEG meaningfully
	extends the spatio-temporal resolution and sensitivity of each method.},

	resonance (MR) imaging measures provide predictive prognostic information
	in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI).This study
	was conducted with institutional review board approval and in compliance
	with HIPAA regulations. Written informed consent was obtained from
	all participants or the participants' legal guardians. Cross-validated
	discriminant analyses of MR imaging measures were performed to differentiate
	164 Alzheimer disease (AD) cases from 203 healthy control cases.
	Separate analyses were performed by using data from MR images obtained
	at one time point or by combining single-time-point measures with
	1-year change measures. Resulting discriminant functions were applied
	to 317 MCI cases to derive individual patient risk scores. Risk of
	conversion to AD was estimated as a continuous function of risk score
	percentile. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were computed for risk score
	quartiles. Odds ratios (ORs) for the conversion to AD were computed
	between the highest and lowest quartile scores.Individualized risk
	estimates from baseline MR examinations indicated that the 1-year
	risk of conversion to AD ranged from 3\% to 40\% (average group risk,
	17\%; OR, 7.2 for highest vs lowest score quartiles). Including measures
	of 1-year change in global and regional volumes significantly improved
	risk estimates (P = 001), with the risk of conversion to AD in the
	subsequent year ranging from 3\% to 69\% (average group risk, 27\%;
	OR, 12.0 for highest vs lowest score quartiles).Relative to the risk
	of conversion to AD conferred by the clinical diagnosis of MCI alone,
	MR imaging measures yield substantially more informative patient-specific
	risk estimates. Such predictive prognostic information will be critical
	if disease-modifying therapies become available.http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.11101975/-/DC1.},

	partial least squares (PLS). It is unique as a multivariate method
	in its choice of emphasis for analysis, that being the covariance
	between brain images and exogenous blocks representing either the
	experiment design or some behavioral measure. What emerges are spatial
	patterns of brain activity that represent the optimal association
	between the images and either of the blocks. This process differs
	substantially from other multivariate methods in that rather than
	attempting to predict the individual values of the image pixels,
	PLS attempts to explain the relation between image pixels and task
	or behavior. Data from a face encoding and recognition PET rCBF study
	are used to illustrate two types of PLS analysis: an activation analysis
	of task with images and a brain-behavior analysis. The commonalities
	across the two analyses are suggestive of a general face memory network
	differentially engaged during encoding and recognition. PLS thus
	serves as an important extension by extracting new information from
	imaging data that is not accessible through other currently used
	univariate and multivariate image analysis tools.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is most commonly
	associated with TAR-DNA binding protein (TDP-43) or tau pathology
	at autopsy, but there are no in vivo biomarkers reliably discriminating
	between sporadic cases. As disease-modifying treatments emerge, it
	is critical to accurately identify underlying pathology in living
	patients so that they can be entered into appropriate etiology-directed
	clinical trials. Patients with tau inclusions (FTLD-TAU) appear to
	have relatively greater white matter (WM) disease at autopsy than
	those patients with TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP). In this paper, we investigate
	the ability of white matter (WM) imaging to help discriminate between
	FTLD-TAU and FTLD-TDP during life using diffusion tensor imaging
	(DTI). METHODS: Patients with autopsy-confirmed disease or a genetic
	mutation consistent with FTLD-TDP or FTLD-TAU underwent multimodal
	T1 volumetric MRI and diffusion weighted imaging scans. We quantified
	cortical thickness in GM and fractional anisotropy (FA) in WM. We
	performed Eigenanatomy, a statistically robust dimensionality reduction
	algorithm, and used leave-one-out cross-validation to predict underlying
	pathology. Neuropathological assessment of GM and WM disease burden
	was performed in the autopsy-cases to confirm our findings of an
	ante-mortem GM and WM dissociation in the neuroimaging cohort. RESULTS:
	ROC curve analyses evaluated classification accuracy in individual
	patients and revealed 96\% sensitivity and 100\% specificity for
	WM analyses. FTLD-TAU had significantly more WM degeneration and
	inclusion severity at autopsy relative to FTLD-TDP. CONCLUSIONS:
	These neuroimaging and neuropathological investigations provide converging
	evidence for greater WM burden associated with FTLD-TAU, and emphasise
	the role of WM neuroimaging for in vivo discrimination between FTLD-TAU
	and FTLD-TDP.},

	there may be qualitatively different symptoms during stages of FTD.
	Finally, pathologic and genetic variability contributes to the clinical

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The anterior commissure (AC) and substantia
	innominata (SI) can be clearly demonstrated at 3T high-resolution
	MR imaging. Our aim was to investigate if atrophy of the AC and SI
	on 3T MR imaging differs among patients with frontotemporal lobar
	degeneration (FTLD) and {A}lzheimer dementia (AD) and healthy subjects.
	MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seven consecutive patients with FTLD, 20 patients
	with AD, and 16 age-matched control subjects were enrolled. MR imaging
	was performed at 3T. The AC thickness as well as the SI thickness
	was measured on a thin-section coronal T2-weighted image, and the
	AC area was measured on a sagittal T1-weighted image. The measurement
	differences among the participants were analyzed with the Kruskal-Wallis
	test. A correlation of the measurement with the Mini-Mental State
	Examination ({M}{M}{S}{E}) score was obtained with the Spearman rank
	correlation test. RESULTS: Thinning of the AC was significantly more
	prominent in FTLD than in AD (P < .001). Although the right SI thickness
	was significantly decreased in patients with AD as compared with
	control subjects (P < .05), there was no significant difference,
	with a substantial overlap of the average SI thickness among the
	3 groups. The thickness and the area of the AC were positively correlated
	with the {M}{M}{S}{E} score (rho = 0.612, P < .001, and rho = 0.659,
	P < .001, respectively). In contrast, the average SI thickness showed
	a weak positive correlation with the {M}{M}{S}{E} score (rho = 0.325,
	P < .05). CONCLUSION: Measurement of AC atrophy with 3T MR imaging
	may provide additional diagnostic clues for FTLD and AD. Conversely,
	SI atrophy measurement does not provide an additional benefit in
	the evaluation of FTLD and AD, owing to a considerable overlap in
	the average thickness of bilateral SI.},

  abstract = {Quantifiers are very common in everyday speech, but we know little
	about their cognitive basis or neural representation. The present
	study examined comprehension of three classes of quantifiers that
	depend on different cognitive components in patients with focal neurodegenerative
	diseases. Patients evaluated the truth-value of a sentence containing
	a quantifier relative to a picture illustrating a small number of
	familiar objects, and performance was related to MRI grey matter
	atrophy using voxel-based morphometry. We found that patients with
	corticobasal syndrome (CBS) and posterior cortical atrophy (PCA)
	are significantly impaired in their comprehension of cardinal quantifiers
	(e.g. "At least three birds are on the branch"), due in part to their
	deficit in quantity knowledge. MRI analyses related this deficit
	to temporal-parietal atrophy found in CBS/PCA. We also found that
	patients with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD)
	are significantly impaired in their comprehension of logical quantifiers
	(e.g. "Some of the birds are on the branch"), associated with a simple
	form of perceptual logic, and this correlated with their deficit
	on executive measures. This deficit was related to disease in rostral
	prefrontal cortex in bvFTD. These patients were also impaired in
	their comprehension of majority quantifiers (e.g. "At least half
	of the birds are on the branch"), and this too was correlated with
	their deficit on executive measures. This was related to disease
	in the basal ganglia interrupting a frontal-striatal loop critical
	for executive functioning. These findings suggest that a large-scale
	frontal-parietal neural network plays a crucial role in quantifier
	comprehension, and that comprehension of specific classes of quantifiers
	may be selectively impaired in patients with focal neurodegenerative
	conditions in these areas.},

  abstract = {Non-negative matrix factorization {(NMF)}, i.e. V ap {WH} where both
	V, W and H are non-negative has become a widely used blind source
	separation technique due to its part based representation. The {NMF}
	decomposition is not in general unique and a part based representation
	not guaranteed. However, imposing sparseness both improves the uniqueness
	of the decomposition and favors part based representation. Sparseness
	in the form of attaining as many zero elements in the solution as
	possible is appealing from a conceptional point of view and corresponds
	to minimizing reconstruction error with an L$_{\textrm{0}}$ norm
	constraint. In general, solving for a given L$_{\textrm{0}}$ norm
	is an {NP} hard problem thus convex relaxation to regularization
	by the L$_{\textrm{1}}$ norm is often considered, i.e., minimizing
	{(1/2{\textbar}{\textbar}V} - {WH{\textbar}{\textbar}$_{\textrm{F}}$}
	$^{\textrm{2}}$ + {lambda{\textbar}{\textbar}H{\textbar}{\textbar}$_{\textrm{1}}$).An}
	open problem is to control the degree of sparsity lambda imposed.
	We here demonstrate that a full regularization path for the L$_{\textrm{1}}$
	norm regularized least squares {NMF} for fixed W can be calculated
	at the cost of an ordinary least squares solution based on a modification
	of the least angle regression and selection {(LARS)} algorithm forming
	a non-negativity constrained {LARS} {(NLARS).} With the full regularization
	path, the L$_{\textrm{1}}$ regularization strength lambda that best
	approximates a given L$_{\textrm{0}}$ can be directly accessed and
	in effect used to control the sparsity of H. The {MATLAB} code for
	the {NLARS} algorithm is available for download.},

	using large-scale population data from ADNI, the precise shape of
	this association. We considered six different models (linear; quadratic;
	robust quadratic; local quadratic regression; penalized B-spline;
	and sigmoid) and used the Akaike Information Criterion to gauge how
	well these models compare in conforming to the data. We included
	576 subjects (229 controls, 193 AD, and 154 mild cognitive impairment
	subjects who converted to AD) from the ADNI study, for whom baseline
	data on cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-? (A?)42, phosphorylated tau
	(p-tau), and total-tau (t-tau), hippocampal volumes, and FDG-PET
	were available. Analysis of this cross-sectional dataset showed that
	a local quadratic regression model was 42\% more likely than a sigmoid
	to be the best model for A?42. This ratio augments to 22\% and 73\%
	for Penalized B-Spline in the case of p-tau and t-tau, respectively;
	to 3500\% for the linear model for FDG-PET; and to 6700\% for the
	Penalized B-Spline for hippocampal volumes. Preliminary, cross-sectional
	evidence therefore indicates that the shape of the association with
	disease severity is non-linear and differs between biomarkers.},

  abstract = {Familial autosomal dominant frontotemporal dementia with ubiquitin-positive,
	tau-negative inclusions in the brain linked to 17q21-22 recently
	has been reported to carry null mutations in the progranulin gene
	(PGRN). Hereditary dysphasic disinhibition dementia (HDDD) is a frontotemporal
	dementia with prominent changes in behavior and language deficits.
	A previous study found significant linkage to chromosome 17 in a
	HDDD family (HDDD2), but no mutation in the MAPT gene. Longitudinal
	follow-up has enabled us to identify new cases and to further characterize
	the dementia in this family. The goals of this study were to develop
	research criteria to classify the different clinical expressions
	of dementia observed in this large kindred, to identify the causal
	mutation in affected individuals and correlate this with phenotypic
	characteristics in this pedigree, and to assess the neuropathological
	characteristics using immunohistochemical techniques.In this study
	we describe a detailed clinical, pathological and mutation analysis
	of the HDDD2 kindred.Neuropathologically, HDDD2 represents a familial
	frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin-positive, tau-negative
	inclusions (FTLD-U). We developed research classification criteria
	and identified three distinct diagnostic thresholds, which helped
	localize the disease locus. The chromosomal region with the strongest
	evidence of linkage lies within the minimum critical region for FTLD-U.
	Sequencing of each exon of the PGRN gene led to the identification
	of a novel missense mutation, Ala-9 Asp, within the signal peptide.HDDD2
	is an FTLD-U caused by a missense mutation in the PGRN gene that
	cosegregates with the disease and with the disease haplotype in at-risk
	individuals. This mutation is the first reported pathogenic missense
	mutation in the signal peptide of the PGRN gene causing FTLD-U. In
	light of the previous reports of null mutations and its position
	in the gene, two possible pathological mechanisms are proposed: (1)
	the protein may accumulate within the endoplasmic reticulum due to
	inefficient secretion; and (2) mutant RNA may have a lower expression
	because of degradation via nonsense-mediated decay.},

  abstract = {Basophilic Inclusion Body Disease (BIBD) is a tau-negative form of
	frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), characterized by neuronal
	cytoplasmic inclusions (NCI) that are visible on hematoxylin and
	eosin stain (HE), contain RNA, and are inconsistently ubiquitin-immunoreactive
	(ir). The normal nuclear expression of TDP-43 is not altered. Here
	we investigate whether the distribution of the structurally and functionally
	related protein fused in sarcoma (FUS) is altered in BIBD. Mutations
	in the FUS gene have recently been identified as a cause of familial
	amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In addition to these familial
	ALS cases, FUS protein has recently been demonstrated in NCI in a
	subset of FTLD with ubiquitinated inclusions (atypical FTLD-U) and
	in neuronal intermediate filament inclusion disease (NIFID). We examined
	seven BIBD brains of patients with average age at onset 46 (range
	29-57) and average duration of disease 8 years (range 5-12). Three
	cases presented with the behavioural variant of fronto-temporal dementia
	(FTD-bv) and one with FTD-bv combined with severe dysarthria. All
	four developed motor neuron disease/ALS syndrome (MND/ALS) several
	years later. In the other three cases, presentation was predominantly
	with motor symptoms, construed as MND/ALS in two, and progressive
	supranuclear palsy (PSP) in one. Severity of cortical degeneration
	varied, but all cases shared severe nigrostriatal atrophy and lower
	motor neuron pathology. In spared areas of cortex, FUS antibodies
	showed intense labelling of neuronal nuclei and weak positivity of
	cytoplasm, whereas, in affected areas, intense labelling of NCI was
	accompanied by reduction or disappearance of the normal IR pattern.
	The number of FUS-ir NCI was much greater than the number detected
	by HE or with ubiquitin or P62 immunohistochemistry. FUS-ir glial
	cytoplasmic inclusions (GCI) were abundant in the grey and white
	matter in all cases, whereas neuronal intranuclear inclusions were
	rare and only seen in 2/7 cases. Thus, BIBD shares with atypical
	FTLD-U and NIFID the presence of FUS-ir NCI and GCI, and together
	comprise a new biochemical category of neurodegenerative disease
	(FUS proteinopathies). The consistent involvement of motorneurons
	in BIBD indicates that the association of FTLD and MND/ALS can occur
	on a FUS or TDP-43 pathological substrate.},

  abstract = {Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)
	are part of a disease spectrum associated with TDP-43 pathology.
	Strong evidence supporting this is the existence of kindreds with
	family members affected by FTD, ALS or mixed features of FTD and
	ALS, referred to as FTD-MND. Some of these families have linkage
	to chromosome 9, with hexanucleotide expansion mutation in a noncoding
	region of C9ORF72. Discovery of the mutation defines c9FTD/ALS. Prior
	to discovery of mutations in C9ORF72, it was assumed that TDP-43
	pathology in c9FTD/ALS was uniform. In this study, we examined the
	neuropathology and clinical features of 20 cases of c9FTD/ALS from
	a brain bank for neurodegenerative disorders. Included are six patients
	clinically diagnosed with ALS, eight FTD, one FTD-MND and four Alzheimer-type
	dementia. Clinical information was unavailable for one patient. Pathologically,
	the cases all had TDP-43 pathology, but there were three major pathologic
	groups: ALS, FTLD-MND and FTLD-TDP. The ALS cases were morphologically
	similar to typical sporadic ALS with almost no extramotor TDP-43
	pathology; all had oligodendroglial cytoplasmic inclusions. The FTLD-MND
	showed predominantly Mackenzie Type 3 TDP-43 pathology, and all had
	ALS-like pathology in motor neurons, but more extensive extramotor
	pathology, with oligodendroglial cytoplasmic inclusions and infrequent
	hippocampal sclerosis. The FTLD-TDP cases had several features similar
	to FTLD-TDP due to mutations in the gene for progranulin, including
	Mackenzie Type 1 TDP-43 pathology with neuronal intranuclear inclusions
	and hippocampal sclerosis. FTLD-TDP patients were older and some
	were thought to have Alzheimer-type dementia. In addition to the
	FTD and ALS clinical presentations, the present study shows that
	c9FTD/ALS can have other presentations, possibly related to age of

	with autopsy-proven CBD and related these observations directly to
	the neuroanatomic distribution of disease. RESULTS: At presentation,
	a specific pattern of cognitive impairment was evident, whereas an
	extrapyramidal motor abnormality was present in less than half of
	the patients. Follow-up examination revealed persistent impairment
	of apraxia and executive functioning, worsening language performance,

	the condition progressed. Statistical analysis associated cognitive
	deficits with tau-immunoreactive pathology that is significantly
	more prominent in frontal and parietal cortices and the basal ganglia
	than temporal neocortex and the hippocampus. CONCLUSION: The clinical
	diagnosis of corticobasal degeneration should depend on a specific
	pattern of impaired cognition as well as an extrapyramidal motor
	disorder, reflecting the neuroanatomic distribution of disease in
	frontal and parietal cortices and the basal ganglia.},

	is hampered by the lack of suitable biomarkers that might be sensitive
	to spatial and temporal patterns of neurodegeneration. Diffusion
	tensor imaging is a useful non-invasive tool that permits detection
	of microstructural tissue changes due, for example, to neurodegeneration.
	Even though the spinal cord bears the brunt of the disease process,
	diffusion tensor imaging has mainly been used to study white matter
	changes in the brain. The aim of this study was to examine the diffusion
	tensor imaging parameters of the cervical spinal cord {(C1} through
	C6 segments) and brainstem (corticospinal tracts in the pyramids
	and pons) among {ALS} patients, to compare these to findings in age-matched
	healthy controls, and to correlate these differences with clinical
	measures of disease severity. Fractional anisotropy in the white
	matter of the cervical cord was 12\% lower (p{\textless}0.01) in
	{ALS} patients (n=14) compared to age-matched healthy control subjects
	(n=15), and showed significant positive correlation with the average
	finger and foot tapping speed (r=0.61, p{\textless}0.05) in {ALS}
	patients. Radial diffusivity in the cervical cord was 15\% higher
	(p{\textless}0.05) in {ALS} patients compared to healthy control
	subjects. Radial diffusivity in the white matter of the cervical
	cord was significantly correlated with clinical measures of disease
	severity such as forced vital capacity {(FVC} \% predicted, r=-0.69,
	p{\textless}0.01), average finger and foot tapping speed from all
	four limbs (r=-0.59, p{\textless}0.05), and {ALSFRS-R} (r=-0.55,
	p{\textless}0.05) in {ALS} patients. There were no significant differences
	in mean diffusivity or axial diffusivity in the cervical spinal cord,
	or in any diffusion tensor imaging parameters measured in the brainstem.
	Analysis of diffusion tensor imaging parameters from individual cervical
	segments as well as profile plots along the length of the cervical
	cord showed larger differences in fractional anisotropy and radial
	diffusivity at more distal cervical segments, providing evidence
	that supports the "dying-back" hypothesis of neurodegeneration in

	FTD diagnosed at a mean age of 55 years in a third of individuals

	To develop an automatic atlas-based method for segmentation of fiber
	bundles using High Angular Resolution Diffusion Imaging {(HARDI)}
	data.
	
	
	{HYPOTHESIS}
	
	Quantitative evaluation of diffusion characteristics inside specific
	fiber bundles provides new insights into disease developments, evolutions,
	therapy effects, and surgical interventions.
	
	
	{BACKGROUND}
	
	Most of previous segmentation methods use similarity measures and
	strategies that do not lead to accurate segmentation results. They
	also suffer from subjectivity of initial seeds and regions of interest
	{(ROI)} defined by operator.
	
	
	{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS}
	
	We propose a novel method that uses Spherical Harmonic Coefficients
	{(SHC)} of {HARDI} diffusion signals to compute Orientation Distribution
	Function {(ODF)} and to extract Principal Diffusion Directions {(PDDs).}
	The proposed method selects most collinear {PDD} of neighbors of
	each voxel. Then, based on {SHC} and selected {PDD}, a similarity
	measure is proposed and used as a speed function in the level set
	framework that segments fiber bundles. To automate the process, an
	atlas-based method is used to select initial seeds for fiber bundles.
	To generate data for evaluation of the proposed method, an artificial
	pattern consisting of three crossing bundles intersected by a circular
	bundle is created. Also, two normal controls are imaged by two different
	{HARDI} protocols.
	
	
	{RESULTS}
	
	Segmentation results for different fiber bundles in simulated data
	and normal control data are presented. Influence of threshold selection
	on the proposed segmentation method is evaluated using Dice coefficient.
	Also, effect of increasing the number of gradient directions on accuracy
	of extracted {PDDs} is evaluated.
	
	
	{CONCLUSION}
	
	The proposed segmentation method has advantages over previous methods
	especially those that use similarity measures based on diffusion
	tensor imaging {(DTI)} data. These advantages are achieved by proper
	propagation of a hyper-surface in fiber crossing areas without making
	assumptions about diffusivity profile and selection of initial seeds
	or {ROI.}},

	on earlier published clinical diagnostic guidelines for frontotemporal

  abstract = {Studies of autobiographical memory in semantic dementia have found
	relative preservation of memories for recent rather than remote events.
	As semantic dementia is associated with progressive atrophy to temporal
	neocortex, with early asymmetric sparing of the hippocampus, this
	neuropsychological pattern suggests that the hippocampal complex
	plays a role in the acquisition and retrieval of recent memories,
	but is not necessary for the recall of older episodic events. In
	an alternative view of memory consolidation, however, the hippocampus
	plays a role in the retrieval of all autobiographical memories, regardless
	of the age of the memory [Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 7(1997)217]. This
	'multiple trace theory' predicts that patients with semantic dementia
	should show no effects of time in their autobiographical recall.
	In this article, we ask whether it is possible to reconcile the data
	from semantic dementia with the multiple trace theory by investigating
	whether the time-dependent pattern of autobiographical retrieval
	seen in the disease is due to (i) patients showing this effect being
	exceptional in their presentation; and/or (ii) patients with semantic
	dementia exhibiting impaired strategic retrieval from concomitant
	frontal damage. A series of experiments in patients with semantic
	dementia, the frontal variant of frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's
	disease clearly demonstrates that neither of these two factors can
	explain the documented effect of time seen in semantic dementia.
	Nonetheless, we discuss how damage to semantic knowledge could result
	in an autobiographical memory deficit and suggest that data from
	semantic dementia may be consistent with both views of hippocampal
	involvement in long-term memory.},

	whether FUS might also be the pathological protein in aFTLD-U. In

	No mutations in the FUS gene were identified in any of our patients.
	These findings suggest that FUS is the pathological protein in a

  abstract = {The genome-wide association study (GWAS) approach has discovered
	hundreds of genetic variants associated with diseases and quantitative
	traits. However, despite clinical overlap and statistical correlation
	between many phenotypes, GWAS are generally performed one-phenotype-at-a-time.
	Here we compare the performance of modelling multiple phenotypes
	jointly with that of the standard univariate approach. We introduce
	a new method and software, MultiPhen, that models multiple phenotypes
	simultaneously in a fast and interpretable way. By performing ordinal
	regression, MultiPhen tests the linear combination of phenotypes
	most associated with the genotypes at each SNP, and thus potentially
	captures effects hidden to single phenotype GWAS. We demonstrate
	via simulation that this approach provides a dramatic increase in
	power in many scenarios. There is a boost in power for variants that
	affect multiple phenotypes and for those that affect only one phenotype.
	While other multivariate methods have similar power gains, we describe
	several benefits of MultiPhen over these. In particular, we demonstrate
	that other multivariate methods that assume the genotypes are normally
	distributed, such as canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and MANOVA,
	can have highly inflated type-1 error rates when testing case-control
	or non-normal continuous phenotypes, while MultiPhen produces no
	such inflation. To test the performance of MultiPhen on real data
	we applied it to lipid traits in the Northern Finland Birth Cohort
	1966 (NFBC1966). In these data MultiPhen discovers 21\% more independent
	SNPs with known associations than the standard univariate GWAS approach,
	while applying MultiPhen in addition to the standard approach provides
	37\% increased discovery. The most associated linear combinations
	of the lipids estimated by MultiPhen at the leading SNPs accurately
	reflect the Friedewald Formula, suggesting that MultiPhen could be
	used to refine the definition of existing phenotypes or uncover novel
	heritable phenotypes.},

  abstract = {Alzheimer's disease with early onset often presents with a distinct
	cognitive profile, potentially reflecting a different distribution
	of underlying neuropathology. The purpose of this study was to examine
	the relationships between age and both in vivo fibrillary amyloid
	deposition and glucose metabolism in patients with Alzheimer's disease.
	Dynamic [(11)C]Pittsburgh compound-B (90 min) and static [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose
	(15 min) scans were obtained in 100 patients with Alzheimer's disease
	and 20 healthy controls. Parametric non-displaceable binding potential
	images of [(11)C]Pittsburgh compound-B and standardized uptake value
	ratio images of [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose were generated using cerebellar
	grey matter as reference tissue. Nine [(11)C]Pittsburgh compound-B-negative
	patients were excluded. The remaining patients were categorized into
	younger (n=45, age: 56 ± 4 years) and older (n=46, age: 69 ± 5 years)
	groups, based on the median age (62 years) at time of diagnosis.
	Younger patients showed more severe impairment on visuo-spatial function,
	attention and executive function composite scores (P<0.05), while
	we found a trend towards poorer memory performance for older patients
	(P=0.11). Differences between groups were assessed using a general
	linear model with repeated measures (gender adjusted) with age as
	between subjects factor, region (frontal, temporal, parietal and
	occipital and posterior cingulate cortices) as within subjects factor
	and [(11)C]Pittsburgh compound-B binding/[(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose
	uptake as dependent variables. There was no main effect of age for
	[(11)C]Pittsburgh compound-B or [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose, suggesting
	that overall, the extent of amyloid deposition or glucose hypometabolism
	did not differ between groups. Regional distributions of [(11)C]Pittsburgh
	compound-B binding and [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose uptake (both P for
	interaction <0.05) differed between groups, however, largely due
	to increased [(11)C]Pittsburgh compound-B binding and decreased [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose
	uptake in the parietal cortex of younger patients (both P<0.05).
	Linear regression analyses showed negative associations between visuo-spatial
	functioning and parietal [(11)C]Pittsburgh compound-B binding for
	younger patients (standardized ?: -0.37) and between visuo-spatial
	functioning and occipital binding for older patients (standardized
	?: -0.39). For [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose, associations were found
	between parietal uptake with visuo-spatial (standardized ?: 0.55),
	attention (standardized ?: 0.39) and executive functioning (standardized
	?: 0.37) in younger patients, and between posterior cingulate uptake
	and memory in older patients (standardized ?: 0.41, all P<0.05).
	These in vivo findings suggest that clinical differences between
	younger and older patients with Alzheimer's disease are not restricted
	to topographical differentiation in downstream processes but may
	originate from distinctive distributions of early upstream events.
	As such, increased amyloid burden, together with metabolic dysfunction,
	in the parietal lobe of younger patients with Alzheimer's disease
	may contribute to the distinct cognitive profile in these patients.},

	the orientation of the principal direction of diffusion defined for
	each image voxel. Running the streamline process repeatedly using
	Monte Carlo methods to exploit this inherent uncertainty generates
	maps of connection probability. Uncertainty is defined by interpreting
	the shape of the diffusion orientation profile provided by the diffusion
	tensor in terms of the underlying microstructure. RESULTS: Two candidates
	for describing the uncertainty in the diffusion tensor are proposed
	and maps of probability of connection to chosen start points or regions
	are generated in a number of major tracts. CONCLUSION: The methods
	presented provide a generic framework for utilizing streamline methods
	to generate probabilistic maps of connectivity.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Frontotemporal dementia (FTD), the second commonest degenerative
	cause of dementia under the age of 65, often presents with striking
	changes in behaviour and personality in association with frontal
	lobe atrophy. Based on the behavioural changes observed in FTD, it
	is commonly assumed that the orbitofrontal cortex is the earliest
	and most severely affected frontal sub-region. However, evidence
	to support this assumption has to date been largely lacking. METHODS:
	Using a novel volumetric {M}{R}{I} method, we performed a detailed
	volumetric analysis of six frontal regions in 12 subjects with the
	frontal or behavioural variant of FTD (fvFTD) and 12 age-, education-
	and sex-matched normal controls. The regions studied were: the orbitofrontal
	and insula regions (representing the orbitobasal cortex); the inferior
	and middle frontal regions (representing the dorsolateral prefrontal
	areas); and the superior frontal and anterior cingulate regions (representing
	the medial prefrontal areas). RESULTS: As a group, the fvFTD patients
	showed atrophy involving all six regions. We then segregated the
	12 patients into three sub-groups according to their overall degree
	of atrophy. In the mildest group (n = 3) all regions fell within
	2 standard deviations of normal. In the intermediate group (n = 6)
	only the orbitofrontal region (bilaterally) fell clearly outside
	the control range (>2 z scores below the control mean); the next
	most atrophic region in this group was the right insular region.
	The severe group (n = 3) had generalized atrophy throughout the frontal
	regions measured. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, patients with the earliest
	stages of fvFTD show no significant loss of volume in any frontal
	lobe area as measured by a novel {M}{R}{I} volumetric technique.
	When volume loss does occur, changes are initially seen in the orbitofrontal
	cortex before atrophy becomes more widespread. These results provide
	some partial support for the often-quoted assumption that the orbitofrontal
	cortex is the locus of earliest pathology in fvFTD, although these
	findings must be regarded as preliminary in view of the small numbers
	of patients involved.},

  abstract = {Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common adult motor
	neuron disease that affects approximately 2/100,000 individuals each
	year worldwide. Patients with ALS suffer from rapidly progressive
	degeneration of motor neurons ultimately leading to death. The major
	pathological features observed in post-mortem tissue from patients
	with ALS are motor neuron loss, cortical spinal tract degeneration,
	gliosis and cytoplasmic neuronal inclusions formed by TDP-43 or TAR
	DNA binding Protein with a molecular mass of 43 kDa, which are now
	recognized as the signature lesions of sporadic ALS. TDP-43 possesses
	two RNA binding domains (RBD) and a glycine-rich C terminus classifying
	it with other heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins known as 2XRBD-Gly
	proteins. A number of reports showed that a subset of patients with
	ALS possess mutations in the TDP-43 (TARDBP) gene. This further strengthens
	the hypotheses that gain of toxic function or loss of function in
	TDP-43 causes ALS. Currently, 29 different TARDBP missense mutations
	have been reported in 51 unrelated sporadic or familial ALS cases
	and two cases of ALS plus concomitant frontotemporal lobar degeneration
	with a remarkable concentration of mutations in the C-terminal glycine-rich
	domain of TDP-43. As these mutations will most certainly be an invaluable
	tool for the design and implementation of ALS animal and cell models,
	as well as serve as a platform for exploring the pathobiology of
	TDP-43, here we summarize the identified pathogenic TARDBP mutations
	and their potential impact on our understanding of the role of TDP-43

	has sporadic and inherited forms. ALS is the most common neurodegenerative
	disorder of young and middle-aged adults, and few treatments are
	available. Although the degeneration predominantly affects the motor
	system, cognitive and behavioural symptoms have been described for
	over a century, and there is evidence that ALS and frontotemporal
	dementia overlap clinically, radiologically, pathologically, and
	genetically. Cognitive decline in ALS is characterised by personality
	change, irritability, obsessions, poor insight, and pervasive deficits
	in frontal executive tests. This presentation is consistent with
	the changes to character, social conduct, and executive function
	in frontotemporal dementia. We highlight genetic, imaging, and neuropathological
	evidence that non-motor systems are affected in ALS and explain the
	importance of recent discoveries. We review studies of cognitive
	impairment in ALS and common neuropsychological test results. We
	also provide advice about clinical assessment of frontotemporal dysfunction
	in patients with ALS, and suggest future research. Understanding
	of cognitive impairment in ALS will improve care for patients and

	The semiautomated component of this approach, which minimizes user

	relies on "incomplete labeling." Incomplete labeling requires the
	user to quickly and approximately segment a few key regions of the

	to guide volumetric diffeomorphic normalization between an individual

	hippocampi. We solve this many-to-few and few-to-many matching problem,
	and gain robustness to inter and intrarater variability and small
	errors in user labeling, by embedding the template-based normalization
	within a probabilistic framework that examines both label geometry
	and appearance data at each label. We evaluate the reliability of
	this framework with respect to manual labeling and show that it increases
	minimum performance levels relative to fully automated approaches
	and provides high inter-rater reliability. Thus, this approach does
	not require expert neuroanatomical training and is viable for high-throughput
	studies of both the normal and the highly atrophic hippocampus.},

	aphasia, bradykinesia, and rigidity. Neuropathological changes include
	frontotemporal atrophy often associated with atrophy of the basal
	ganglia, substantia nigra, and amygdala. Neurofibrillary tangles
	(NFTs) are seen in some but not all families. Inheritance is autosomal
	dominant and the gene has been regionally localized to 17q21-22 in
	a 2- to 4-centimorgan (cM) region flanked by markers D17S800 and
	D17S791. The gene for tau, the primary component of NFTs, is located
	in the same region of chromosome 17. Tau was evaluated as a candidate
	gene. Physical mapping studies place tau within 2 megabases or less
	of D17S791, but it is probably outside the D17S800-D17S791 FTDP-17
	interval. DNA sequence analysis of tau coding regions in affected
	subjects from two FTDP-17 families revealed nine DNA sequence variants,
	eight of which were also identified in controls and are thus polymorphisms.
	A ninth variant (Val279Met) was found in one FTDP-17 family but not
	in the second FTDP-17 family. Three lines of evidence indicate that
	the Val279Met change is an FTDP-17 causative mutation. First, the
	mutation site is highly conserved, and a normal valine is found at
	this position in all three tau interrepeat sequences and in other
	microtubule associated protein tau homologues. Second, the mutation
	co-segregates with the disease in family A. Third, the mutation is
	not found in normal controls.},

  abstract = {This article illustrates how functional neuroimaging can be used
	to test the validity of neurological and cognitive models of language.
	Three models of language are described: the 19th Century neurological
	model which describes both the anatomy and cognitive components of
	auditory and visual word processing, and 2 20th Century cognitive
	models that are not constrained by anatomy but emphasise 2 different
	routes to reading that are not present in the neurological model.
	A series of functional imaging studies are then presented which show
	that, as predicted by the 19th Century neurologists, auditory and
	visual word repetition engage the left posterior superior temporal
	and posterior inferior frontal cortices. More specifically, the roles
	Wernicke and Broca assigned to these regions lie respectively in
	the posterior superior temporal sulcus and the anterior insula. In
	addition, a region in the left posterior inferior temporal cortex
	is activated for word retrieval, thereby providing a second route
	to reading, as predicted by the 20th Century cognitive models. This
	region and its function may have been missed by the 19th Century
	neurologists because selective damage is rare. The angular gyrus,
	previously linked to the visual word form system, is shown to be
	part of a distributed semantic system that can be accessed by objects
	and faces as well as speech. Other components of the semantic system
	include several regions in the inferior and middle temporal lobes.
	From these functional imaging results, a new anatomically constrained
	model of word processing is proposed which reconciles the anatomical
	ambitions of the 19th Century neurologists and the cognitive finesse
	of the 20th Century cognitive models. The review focuses on single
	word processing and does not attempt to discuss how words are combined
	to generate sentences or how several languages are learned and interchanged.
	Progress in unravelling these and other related issues will depend
	on the integration of behavioural, computational and neurophysiological
	approaches, including neuroimaging.},

	demonstrates excellent stability at high concentrations (0.25 M Bi(3+)),
	high X-ray absorption (fivefold better than iodine), very long circulation

  abstract = {The progranulin gene (GRN) is mutated in 5-10\% of patients with
	frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and in about 20\% of patients
	with familial FTLD. The most common mutation in GRN is Arg493X. We
	aimed to establish the contribution of this mutation to FTLD and
	related disorders.We measured the frequency of Arg493X in 3405 unrelated
	patients with various neurodegenerative diseases using Taqman single-nucleotide
	polymorphism (SNP) genotyping. Clinicopathological characterisation
	and shared haplotype analysis were done for 30 families with FTLD
	who carry Arg493X. To investigate the effect of potential modifying
	loci, we did linear regression analyses with onset age as the covariate
	for GRN variants, for genotypes of the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE),
	and for haplotypes of the microtubule-associated protein tau gene
	(MAPT).Of 731 patients with FTLD, 16 (2\%) carried Arg493X. This
	mutation was not detected in 2674 patients who did not have FTLD.
	In 37 patients with Arg493X from 30 families with FTLD, clinical
	diagnoses included frontotemporal dementia, primary progressive aphasia,
	corticobasal syndrome, and Alzheimer's disease. Range of onset age
	was 44-69 years. In all patients who came to autopsy (n=13), the
	pathological diagnosis was FTLD with neuronal inclusions that contained
	TAR DNA-binding protein or ubiquitin, but not tau. Neurofibrillary
	tangle pathology in the form of Braak staging correlated with overall
	neuropathology in the Arg493X carriers. Haplotype analyses suggested
	that Arg493X arose twice, with a single founder for 27 families.
	Linear regression analyses suggested that patients with SNP rs9897528
	on their wild-type GRN allele have delayed symptom onset. Onset ages
	were not associated with the MAPT H1 or H2 haplotypes or APOE genotypes,
	but early memory deficits were associated with the presence of an
	APOE epsilon4 allele.Clinical heterogeneity is associated with GRN
	haploinsufficiency, and genetic variability on the wild-type GRN
	allele might have a role in the age-related disease penetrance of

	and TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43)-positive frontotemporal dementia
	(FTLD-U), a progressive neurodegenerative disease affecting approximately
	10\% of early-onset dementia patients. Here we expand the role of
	GRN in FTLD-U and demonstrate that a common genetic variant (rs5848),
	located in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of GRN in a binding-site
	for miR-659, is a major susceptibility factor for FTLD-U. In a series

	a 3.2-fold increased risk to develop FTLD-U compared with homozygous
	C-allele carriers (95\% CI: 1.50-6.73). We further demonstrate that
	miR-659 can regulate GRN expression in vitro, with miR-659 binding
	more efficiently to the high risk T-allele of rs5848 resulting in
	augmented translational inhibition of GRN. A significant reduction
	in GRN protein was observed in homozygous T-allele carriers in vivo,

  abstract = {Two extended haplotypes exist across the tau gene-H1 and H2-with
	H1 consistently associated with increased risk of progressive supranuclear
	palsy (PSP). Using 15 haplotype tagging SNPs (htSNPs), capturing
	>95\% of MAPT haplotype diversity, we performed association analysis
	in a US sample of 274 predominantly pathologically confirmed PSP
	patients and 424 matched control individuals. We found that PSP risk
	is associated with one of two major ancestral H1 haplotypes, H1B,
	increasing from 14\% in control individuals to 22\% in PSP patients
	(P<0.001). In young PSP patients, the H1B risk could be localized
	to a 22 kb regulatory region in intron 0 (P<0.001) and could be fully
	explained by one SNP, htSNP167, creating a LBP-1c/LSF/CP2 site, shown
	to regulate the expression of genes in other neurodegenerative disorders.
	Luciferase reporter data indicated that the 182 bp conserved regulatory
	region, in which htSNP167 is located, is transcriptionally active
	with both alleles differentially influencing expression. Further,
	we replicated the htSNP167 association in a second, independently
	ascertained US PSP patient-control sample. However, the htSNP association
	showed that H1 risk alone could not explain the overall differences
	in H1 and H2 frequencies in PSP patients and control individuals.
	Thus, risk variants on different H1 htSNP haplotypes and protective
	variants on H2 contribute to population risk for PSP.},

	MATERIALS AND METHODS: Activation data from a language task and also
	a resting state f{M}{R}{I} data were collected from eight volunteers.
	Data was analyzed using both the rCCA method and the General Linear
	Model (GLM). A modified Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) method
	was used to evaluate the performance of the different analysis methods.
	The area under a fraction of the ROC curve was used as a measure
	of performance. On resting state data the fraction of voxels above
	certain significance thresholds were used to evaluate the significance
	estimation method. RESULTS: The rCCA method scored significantly
	higher on the area under the ROC curve than the GLM. The fraction
	of activated voxels determined by thresholding according to the introduced
	significance estimation technique showed good agreement with the

  abstract = {Aim To compare the diagnostic utility of pelvic ultrasound {(US)}
	and magnetic resonance imaging {(MRI)} on the clinical decision to
	proceed with uterine artery embolization {(UAE).} Materials and methods
	Over 2 years, 180 consecutive women (mean age 43) sought consultation
	for {UAE}, 116 underwent pelvic {US} and {MRI} before possible {UAE.}
	{US} was performed prior to {MRI.} Imaging was analysed for leiomyoma
	quantity, size and location, uterine volume, and the presence of
	potential contraindications to {UAE.} Discrepancies between imaging
	methods and cases where discrepancies could have altered management,
	were recorded. Results For the 116 patients who completed imaging,
	the average uterine volume was 701\&\#xa0;cm3 using {MRI} versus
	658\&\#xa0;cm3 using {US} (p\&\#xa0;=\&\#xa0;0.48). The average dominant
	leiomyoma volume was 292\&\#xa0;cm3 using {MRI} versus 253\&\#xa0;cm3
	using {US} (p\&\#xa0;=\&\#xa0;0.16). In 14 (12.1\%) patients {US}
	did not correctly quantify or localize leiomyomas compared with {MRI}
	(p\&\#xa0;=\&\#xa0;0.0005). Thirteen patients did not undergo {UAE}
	(patient preference n\&\#xa0;=\&\#xa0;9, pre-procedural imaging findings
	n\&\#xa0;=\&\#xa0;4). In the four cases where {UAE} was not performed
	due to imaging findings, relevant findings were all diagnosed by
	{MRI} compared with two by {US} (p\&\#xa0;=\&\#xa0;0.5). The two
	cases not detected by ultrasound were adenomyosis and a pedunculate
	subserosal leiomyoma. Of the 103 patients who underwent {UAE}, 14
	were treated (without complication) despite the presence of a relative
	contraindication; all 14 relative contraindications were identified
	by {MRI} compared with 13 by {US} (p\&\#xa0;=\&\#xa0;1.0). Conclusion
	{MRI} is more accurate than {US} for characterizing uterine leiomyomas.
	In a small but statistically insignificant number of cases, {MRI}
	identified findings that were missed by {US}, which changed management.
	For patients that are unsuitable to be assessed with {MRI}, ultrasound
	alone is sufficient for pre-{UAE} assessment.},

	of a sensitive developmental period for brain maturation. These findings
	indicate that variation in normal childhood experience is associated

	cocaine-exposed adolescents and 25 matched non-cocaine-exposed control

	showed significantly reduced global cerebral blood flow. The decrease
	of cerebral blood flow in cocaine-exposed adolescents was observed
	mainly in posterior and inferior brain regions, including the occipital
	cortex and thalamus. After adjusting for global cerebral blood flow,
	however, a significant increase in relative cerebral blood flow in

	behaviours, hyperorality and dysexecutive neuropsychological profile).
	'Probable' behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia adds functional

	requires histopathological confirmation or a pathogenic mutation.
	Sixteen brain banks contributed cases meeting histopathological criteria

	behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia, Alzheimer's disease,
	dementia with Lewy bodies or vascular dementia at presentation. Cases
	with predominant primary progressive aphasia or extra-pyramidal syndromes
	were excluded. In these autopsy-confirmed cases, an experienced neurologist
	or psychiatrist ascertained clinical features necessary for making
	a diagnosis according to previous and proposed criteria at presentation.
	Of 137 cases where features were available for both proposed and
	previously established criteria, 118 (86\%) met 'possible' criteria,
	and 104 (76\%) met criteria for 'probable' behavioural variant frontotemporal
	dementia. In contrast, 72 cases (53\%) met previously established
	criteria for the syndrome (P?<?0.001 for comparison with 'possible'
	and 'probable' criteria). Patients who failed to meet revised criteria
	were significantly older and most had atypical presentations with
	marked memory impairment. In conclusion, the revised criteria for
	behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia improve diagnostic accuracy
	compared with previously established criteria in a sample with known
	frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Greater sensitivity of the proposed
	criteria may reflect the optimized diagnostic features, less restrictive
	exclusion features and a flexible structure that accommodates different
	initial clinical presentations. Future studies will be needed to
	establish the reliability and specificity of these revised diagnostic
	guidelines.},

  abstract = {Careful selection of the reference region for non-quantitative positron
	emission tomography (PET) analyses is critically important for Region
	of Interest (ROI) data analyses. We introduce an empirical method
	of deriving the most suitable reference region for computing neurodegeneration
	sensitive (18)fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET ratios based on the dataset
	collected by the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)
	study. Candidate reference regions are selected based on a heat map
	of the difference in coefficients of variation (COVs) of FDG ratios
	over time for each of the Automatic Anatomical Labeling (AAL) atlas
	regions normalized by all other AAL regions. Visual inspection of
	the heat map suggests that the portion of the cerebellum and vermis
	superior to the horizontal fissure is the most sensitive reference
	region. Analyses of FDG ratio data show increases in significance
	on the order of ten-fold when using the superior portion of the cerebellum
	as compared with the traditionally used full cerebellum. The approach
	to reference region selection in this paper can be generalized to
	other radiopharmaceuticals and radioligands as well as to other disorders
	where brain changes over time are hypothesized and longitudinal data
	is available. Based on the empirical evidence presented in this study,
	we demonstrate the usefulness of the COV heat map method and conclude
	that intensity normalization based on the superior portion of the
	cerebellum may be most sensitive to measuring change when performing
	longitudinal analyses of FDG-PET ratios as well as group comparisons
	in Alzheimer's disease. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled:

	Furthermore, there is a growing appreciation of the potential utility

	to the variability that is inherent in the available cross-sectional

	avoid over-regularization by initializing the processing in each

	power while preserving the ability to detect large anatomical deviations;

	with TDP-43-negative FTLD-U pathology. To determine the frequency

	or dementia lacking distinctive histopathology. We identified nine
	cases (20\%) with TDP-43-negative FTLD-U pathology by immunohistochemistry
	and confirmed the absence of pathological TDP-43 by biochemical analysis.
	All patients presented with sporadic early-onset frontotemporal dementia
	with predominant behavioral and personality changes. Besides ubiquitin-positive
	neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions, the most intriguing neuropathological
	feature was the presence of ubiquitin-positive neuronal intranuclear
	inclusions (NIIs), often with curved or twisted morphology, in the
	neocortex, hippocampus, brainstem, and spinal cord. Double-label
	immunofluorescence revealed an unusual and distinct immunoreactivity
	profile for these NIIs, with ubiquitin-immunoreactivity, but absence
	of p62 labeling. The highly consistent clinical and neuropathological
	phenotype supports the concept that TDP-43-negative FTLD-U should
	be considered as a new clinicopathological FTLD entity.},

  abstract = {Substantial changes in brain morphology mark the course of alcoholism
	from development through dependence, recovery, and relapse. These
	changes can be characterized with deformation-based morphometry,
	which quantifies shape differences between anatomical structures,
	either in different subjects (cross-sectional) or in the same subject
	over time (longitudinal). Here we present analyses of data from a
	longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study on the effects
	of alcoholism on brain structure. Images were acquired from alcoholic
	women (n=7, mean age 47.8+/-8.3 years) and age-matched control women
	(n=16, mean age 51.2+/-7.5 years). From each subject, we acquired
	two structural MR brain images, separated by approximately 2 years
	(mean 21.6+/-7 months). We performed two types of morphometry using
	log-Jacobian maps of inter-subject and intra-subject nonrigid coordinate
	transformations, justified by the invariance of relevant statistics
	(mean, standard deviation, z-score, and t-test) under changes of
	the spatial and temporal reference coordinate system. With all images
	from one time point, a cross-sectional inter-subject morphometry
	determined group differences between alcoholics and normal controls.
	We compared these results with longitudinal intra-subject morphometry
	based on two images per subject acquired at different times (approximately
	2 years apart). Inter- and intra-subject analysis produced partially
	conflicting results. Whereas the intra-subject analysis indicated
	faster ventricular volume increases in the alcoholics (+11\% per
	year) than in the controls (+2\% per year), the inter-subject analysis
	showed, on average, smaller absolute ventricle volumes in the alcoholics
	than in the controls (-33\% relative volume). These differences were
	confirmed by manual planimetry and were statistically significant
	whether tested based on difference or change, integrated over the
	volume of the ventricles. Other changes and group differences were
	consistent between the two analyses, e.g., reduction of white matter
	(including corpus callosum) and increase in CSF volume, and these
	are in agreement with established effects of alcoholism on brain
	structure. We conclude that intra-subject morphometry of longitudinal
	data is preferable to inter-subject morphometry for detecting dynamic
	changes due to a disease, especially when only small samples are
	available. Our analysis demonstrates that the distinction between
	group differences observed at a point in time vs. over time is not
	merely academic but can substantially reduce the validity of the
	outcomes of actual morphometric studies. This discrepancy in results
	underscores the importance of distinguishing between volume differences
	and volume changes in morphometric analyses.},

	disease.A total of 41.8\% of patients had some family history (score

  abstract = {Relating clinical symptoms to neuroanatomical profiles of brain damage
	and ultimately to tissue pathology is a key challenge in the field
	of neurodegenerative disease and particularly relevant to the heterogeneous
	disorders that comprise the frontotemporal lobar degeneration spectrum.
	Here we present a retrospective analysis of clinical, neuropsychological
	and neuroimaging (volumetric and voxel-based morphometric) features
	in a pathologically ascertained cohort of 95 cases of frontotemporal
	lobar degeneration classified according to contemporary neuropathological
	criteria. Forty-eight cases (51\%) had TDP-43 pathology, 42 (44\%)
	had tau pathology and five (5\%) had fused-in-sarcoma pathology.
	Certain relatively specific clinicopathological associations were
	identified. Semantic dementia was predominantly associated with TDP-43
	type C pathology; frontotemporal dementia and motoneuron disease
	with TDP-43 type B pathology; young-onset behavioural variant frontotemporal
	dementia with FUS pathology; and the progressive supranuclear palsy
	syndrome with progressive supranuclear palsy pathology. Progressive
	non-fluent aphasia was most commonly associated with tau pathology.
	However, the most common clinical syndrome (behavioural variant frontotemporal
	dementia) was pathologically heterogeneous; while pathologically
	proven Pick's disease and corticobasal degeneration were clinically
	heterogeneous, and TDP-43 type A pathology was associated with similar
	clinical features in cases with and without progranulin mutations.

	cluster analyses of the pathological groups here suggested a neuroanatomical
	framework underpinning this clinical and pathological diversity.
	Frontotemporal lobar degeneration-associated pathologies segregated
	based on their cerebral atrophy profiles, according to the following
	scheme: asymmetric, relatively localized (predominantly temporal
	lobe) atrophy (TDP-43 type C); relatively symmetric, relatively localized
	(predominantly temporal lobe) atrophy (microtubule-associated protein
	tau mutations); strongly asymmetric, distributed atrophy (Pick's
	disease); relatively symmetric, predominantly extratemporal atrophy
	(corticobasal degeneration, fused-in-sarcoma pathology). TDP-43 type
	A pathology was associated with substantial individual variation;
	however, within this group progranulin mutations were associated
	with strongly asymmetric, distributed hemispheric atrophy. We interpret
	the findings in terms of emerging network models of neurodegenerative
	disease: the neuroanatomical specificity of particular frontotemporal
	lobar degeneration pathologies may depend on an interaction of disease-specific
	and network-specific factors.},

  abstract = {Semantic dementia is a sporadic neurodegenerative disorder characterized
	by the progressive erosion of semantic processing and is one of the
	canonical subtypes of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. This study
	aimed to characterize the pattern of global and regional longitudinal
	brain atrophy in semantic dementia and to identify imaging biomarkers
	that could underpin therapeutic trials.Twenty-one patients with semantic
	dementia (including eight pathologically confirmed cases) underwent
	whole-brain and region-of-interest analyses on volumetric brain MRI
	scans at two time points. Sample size estimates for trials were subsequently
	calculated using these data.Mean (SD) whole-brain atrophy rate was
	39.6 (31.9) mL/y [3.2 (12.0) mL/y in controls], with ventricular
	enlargement of 8.9 (4.4) mL/y [1.0 (1.0) mL/y in controls]. All patients
	had a smaller left temporal lobe at baseline [left mean 31.9 (6.9)
	mL, right mean 49.2 (9.5) mL; p < 0.0001]; however, the mean rate
	of atrophy was significantly greater in the right temporal lobe [right
	3.9 (1.7) mL/y, left 2.8 (1.2) mL/y; p = 0.02]. Similarly, whereas
	the left hippocampus was smaller at baseline, the mean atrophy rate
	was significantly greater in the right hippocampus. Using the atrophy
	rates generated, sample size requirements for clinical trials were
	found to be smallest for temporal lobe measurement.These findings
	show that the rate of tissue loss in the right temporal lobe overtakes
	the left temporal lobe as semantic dementia evolves, consistent with
	the later development of symptoms attributable to right temporal
	lobe dysfunction. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate that MRI
	measures of temporal lobe volume loss could provide a feasible and
	sensitive index of disease progression in semantic dementia.},

  abstract = {Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a clinically, pathologically and
	genetically heterogeneous disorder. Mutations in a number of genes
	are associated with FTD, although until recently only two [progranulin
	(GRN) and microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT)] were known to
	be major causes of the disease. This review describes recent progress
	in identifying clinical and neuroanatomical phenotypes associated
	with autosomal-dominant FTD.Around a third to a half of FTD patients
	have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Up to 10\% of
	patients have a mutation in GRN and a similar proportion have a mutation
	in MAPT. Recently a group of patients have been shown to have a hexanucleotide
	repeat expansion in the noncoding region of chromosome 9 open reading
	frame 72 (C9ORF72). A further group of patients have an autosomal
	dominant family history but no mutations in any of the known genes
	including a group of patients who have the same pathology as GRN
	mutations (type A TDP-43 pathology) but are negative for GRN mutations.
	Clinical phenotypes vary across the different mutations. Neuroimaging
	studies show that GRN and MAPT mutations have distinct patterns of
	atrophy--asymmetric fronto-temporo-parietal atrophy with GRN versus
	relatively symmetric medial temporal and orbitofrontal lobe atrophy
	with MAPT mutations. Neuroimaging of patients with an expansion in
	C9ORF72 has yet to be studied in detail.Genetic FTD is heterogeneous

	templates that allow normalization algorithms to be applied to stroke-aged
	populations. First, we developed a CT template: while this is the
	dominant modality for many clinical situations, there are no modern
	CT templates and popular algorithms fail to successfully normalize
	CT scans. Importantly, our template was based on healthy individuals
	with ages similar to what is commonly seen in stroke (mean 65 years
	old). This template allows studies where only CT scans are available.
	Second, we derived a MRI template that approximately matches the
	shape of our CT template as well as processing steps that aid the
	normalization of scans from older individuals (including lesion masking
	and the ability to generate high quality cortical renderings despite
	brain injury). The benefit of this strategy is that the resulting
	templates can be used in studies where mixed modalities are present.
	We have integrated these templates and processing algorithms into
	a simple SPM toolbox (http://www.mricro.com/clinical-toolbox/spm8-scripts).},

  abstract = {Measures of brain activation (e.g., changes in scalp electrical potentials)
	have become the most popular method for inferring brain function.
	However, examining brain disruption (e.g., examining behavior after
	brain injury) can complement activation studies. Activation techniques
	identify regions involved with a task, whereas disruption techniques
	are able to discover which regions are crucial for a task. Voxel-based
	lesion mapping can be used to determine relationships between behavioral
	measures and the location of brain injury, revealing the function
	of brain regions. Lesion mapping can also correlate the effectiveness
	of neurosurgery with the location of brain resection, identifying
	optimal surgical targets. Traditionally, voxel-based lesion mapping
	has employed the chi-square test when the clinical measure is binomial
	and the Student's t test when measures are continuous. Here we suggest
	that the Liebermeister approach for binomial data is more sensitive
	than the chi-square test. We also suggest that a test described by
	Brunner and Munzel is more appropriate than the t test for nonbinomial
	data because clinical and neuropsychological data often violate the
	assumptions of the t test. We test our hypotheses comparing statistical
	tests using both simulated data and data obtained from a sample of
	stroke patients with disturbed spatial perception. We also developed
	software to implement these tests (MRIcron), made freely available

	Neural redundancy and plastic remodelling of brain networking, also
	secondary to mental and physical training, promotes maintenance of
	brain activity in healthy elderly for everyday life and fully productive
	affective and intellectual capabilities. However, age is the main
	risk factor for neurodegenerative disorders such as {A}lzheimer's
	disease (AD) that impact on cognition. Oscillatory electromagnetic
	brain activity is a hallmark of neuronal network function in various

	(EEG), event-related potential (ERP), magnetoencephalography (MEG),
	and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can accurately index
	normal and abnormal brain aging to facilitate non-invasive analysis
	of cortico-cortical connectivity and neuronal synchronization of
	firing and coherence of rhythmic oscillations at various frequencies.
	The present review provides a perspective of these issues by assaying
	different neurophysiological methods and integrating the results
	with functional brain imaging findings. It is concluded that discrimination
	between physiological and pathological brain aging clearly emerges
	at the group level, with applications at the individual level also

  abstract = {Hereditary frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is an autosomal dominant
	neurodegenerative disorder that is associated with mutations in the
	tau gene and with the pathological accumulation of hyperphosphorylated
	tau protein in affected brain cells in about a quarter of cases.
	However, most FTD families have no demonstrable tau mutations. Here
	we describe the clinical and neuropathological features of a large
	family with hereditary FTD. Genetic analysis showed strong evidence
	for linkage to chromosome 17q21-22 (maximum lod score 3.46, theta
	= 0 for marker D17S950), but mutations in the tau gene were not found.
	Clinical symptoms, neuropsychological deficits and neuroimaging findings
	of affected family members were similar to sporadic and tau-related
	FTD. The mean age at onset was 61.2 years, with loss of initiative
	and decreased spontaneous speech as the most prominent presenting
	symptoms. Pathological examination of the brains of two affected
	family members showed non-specific neuronal degeneration with dense
	cytoplasmic ubiquitin-positive inclusions in neurones of the second
	layer of the frontotemporal cortex and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus.
	In a number of neurones these inclusions appeared to be located inside
	the nucleus, although due to the small number of these inclusions
	this localization could not be confirmed by electron microscopy.
	The inclusions were not stained by tau, alpha-synuclein or polyglutamine
	antibodies. Biochemical analysis of soluble tau did not reveal abnormalities
	in tau isoform distribution and analysis of mRNA showed the presence
	of both three- and four-repeat transcripts. This is the first report
	of ubiquitin-positive, tau-negative inclusions in an FTD family with
	significant linkage to chromosome 17q21-22. Further characterization
	of the ubiquitin-positive inclusions may clarify the neurodegenerative
	pathways involved in this subtype of FTD.},

  abstract = {Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal adult-onset disease
	in which motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord degenerate by
	largely unknown mechanisms. ALS is familial (FALS) in 10\% of cases,
	and the inheritance is usually dominant, with variable penetrance.
	Mutations in copper/zinc super oxide dismutase (SOD1) are found in
	20\% of familial and 3\% of sporadic ALS cases. Five families with
	ALS and frontotemporal dementia (ALS-FTD) are linked to 9q21, whereas
	one family with pure ALS is linked to 18q21. We identified two large
	European families with ALS without SOD1 mutations or linkage to known
	FALS loci and conducted a genomewide linkage screen using 400 microsatellite
	markers. In both families, two-point LOD scores >1 and a haplotype
	segregating with disease were demonstrated only across regions of
	chromosome 16. Subsequent fine mapping in family 1 gave a maximum
	two-point LOD score of 3.62 at D16S3137 and a three-point LOD score
	of 3.85 for markers D16S415 and D16S3137. Haplotype analysis revealed
	no recombination > approximately 30 cM, (flanking markers at D16S3075
	and D16S3112). The maximum two-point LOD score for family 2 was 1.84
	at D16S415, and the three-point LOD score was 2.10 for markers D16S419
	and D16S415. Definite recombination occurred in several individuals,
	which narrowed the shared haplotype in affected individuals to a
	10.1-cM region (flanking markers: D16S3396 and D16S3112). The region
	shared by both families on chromosome 16q12 corresponds to approximately
	4.5 Mb on the Marshfield map. Bioinformatic analysis of the region
	has identified 18 known genes and 70 predicted genes in this region,
	and sequencing of candidate genes has now begun.},

	proportion of computed tomography {(CT)} studies. Contrast media
	are indispensable to more clearly differentiate anatomic structures
	and to detect and characterize abnormalities. Depending on the indication
	up to 200 ml of these agents are injected during {CT.} Despite these
	large amounts adverse effects are rare and have further decreased
	with the introduction of non-ionic substances. However, it took 10
	to 20 years until these non-ionic agents replaced the older ionic
	agents in clinical practice. In recent years no new substance has
	been brought to the market. The introduction of rapid scanning using
	multislice {CT} technology, however, has led to the development of
	more sophisticated contrast injection techniques. Current research
	focuses on optimizing contrast application techniques and on further
	evaluating the safety profiles of the various substances. The amount
	of contrast enhancement obtained in individual patients for instance
	depends on the contrast agent characteristics, such as iodine concentration,
	and the parameters of the contrast injection protocol, such as iodine
	flux and iodine dose. Meanwhile, contrast agent characteristics such
	as osmolality and viscosity play a role in the safety profile of
	an agent. This paper provides a current overview of {CT} contrast
	media, {CT} contrast dynamics, and {CT} contrast applications with

  year = {2009},
  volume = {10},
  pages = {130},
  abstract = {Progranulin is a secreted high molecular weight growth factor bearing
	seven and one half copies of the cysteine-rich granulin-epithelin
	motif. While inappropriate over-expression of the progranulin gene
	has been associated with many cancers, haploinsufficiency leads to
	atrophy of the frontotemporal lobes and development of a form of
	dementia (frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin positive
	inclusions, FTLD-U) associated with the formation of ubiquitinated
	inclusions. Recent reports indicate that progranulin has neurotrophic
	effects, which, if confirmed would make progranulin the only neuroprotective
	growth factor that has been associated genetically with a neurological
	disease in humans. Preliminary studies indicated high progranulin
	gene expression in spinal cord motor neurons. However, it is uncertain
	what the role of Progranulin is in normal or diseased motor neuron
	function. We have investigated progranulin gene expression and subcellular
	localization in cultured mouse embryonic motor neurons and examined
	the effect of progranulin over-expression and knockdown in the NSC-34
	immortalized motor neuron cell line upon proliferation and survival.In
	situ hybridisation and immunohistochemical techniques revealed that
	the progranulin gene is highly expressed by motor neurons within
	the mouse spinal cord and in primary cultures of dissociated mouse
	embryonic spinal cord-dorsal root ganglia. Confocal microscopy coupled
	to immunocytochemistry together with the use of a progranulin-green
	fluorescent protein fusion construct revealed progranulin to be located
	within compartments of the secretory pathway including the Golgi
	apparatus. Stable transfection of the human progranulin gene into
	the NSC-34 motor neuron cell line stimulates the appearance of dendritic
	structures and provides sufficient trophic stimulus to survive serum
	deprivation for long periods (up to two months). This is mediated
	at least in part through an anti-apoptotic mechanism. Control cells,
	while expressing basal levels of progranulin do not survive in serum
	free conditions. Knockdown of progranulin expression using shRNA
	technology further reduced cell survival.Neurons are among the most
	long-lived cells in the body and are subject to low levels of toxic
	challenges throughout life. We have demonstrated that progranulin
	is abundantly expressed in motor neurons and is cytoprotective over
	prolonged periods when over-expressed in a neuronal cell line. This
	work highlights the importance of progranulin as neuroprotective
	growth factor and may represent a therapeutic target for neurodegenerative
	diseases including motor neuron disease.},

	global and cognitive decline assessed clinically with the neuropathological
	changes observed in a large prospectively characterized cohort of
	mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and {A}lzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS:
	We examined 150 subjects (16 MCI and 134 AD) that were prospectively
	assessed and longitudinally followed to autopsy. MCI subjects clinically
	met Petersen criteria for single or multi-domain amnestic MCI. AD
	subjects clinically met NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for probable or possible
	AD. All subjects received the Functional Assessment Staging (FAST),
	the Global Deterioration Scale (GDS), and the Mini Mental State Examination
	({M}{M}{S}{E}) ante-mortem. Plaque and tangle counts were gathered
	for hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, frontal, temporal and parietal
	cortices. Braak staging was performed as well. RESULTS: The GDS,
	FAST and {M}{M}{S}{E} correlated with plaque counts in all regions.
	The GDS, FAST and {M}{M}{S}{E} correlated with tangle counts in in
	all regions. The three instruments also correlated with the Braak
	score. The {M}{M}{S}{E} and GDS correlate better than the FAST in
	most regions. CONCLUSIONS: Accumulation of neuropathology appears
	to correlate with functional, global, and cognitive decline as people
	progress from MCI through AD.},

	dimorphism in human face as a function of age and of face features.
	Features are grouped into six categories: head, eyes, orbits, nose,
	lips, and mouth, and ears. We demonstrate that the face of adult
	males is significantly different from adult females. We also identify
	the features that significantly contribute to the dimorphism of the
	face. This provides a basis for gender-based classification of faces.

  abstract = {Lesions of the cerebral white matter (WM) result in focal neurobehavioral
	syndromes, neuropsychiatric phenomena, and dementia. The cerebral
	WM contains fiber pathways that convey axons linking cerebral cortical
	areas with each other and with subcortical structures, facilitating
	the distributed neural circuits that subserve sensorimotor function,
	intellect, and emotion. Recent neuroanatomical investigations reveal
	that these neural circuits are topographically linked by five groupings
	of fiber tracts emanating from every neocortical area: (1) cortico-cortical
	association fibers; (2) corticostriatal fibers; (3) commissural fibers;
	and cortico-subcortical pathways to (4) thalamus and (5) pontocerebellar
	system, brain stem, and/or spinal cord. Lesions of association fibers
	prevent communication between cortical areas engaged in different
	domains of behavior. Lesions of subcortical structures or projection/striatal
	fibers disrupt the contribution of subcortical nodes to behavior.
	Disconnection syndromes thus result from lesions of the cerebral
	cortex, subcortical structures, and WM tracts that link the nodes
	that make up the distributed circuits. The nature and the severity
	of the clinical manifestations of WM lesions are determined, in large
	part, by the location of the pathology: discrete neurological and
	neuropsychiatric symptoms result from focal WM lesions, whereas cognitive
	impairment across multiple domains--WM dementia--occurs in the setting
	of diffuse WM disease. We present a detailed review of the conditions
	affecting WM that produce these neurobehavioral syndromes, and consider
	the pathophysiology, clinical effects, and broad significance of
	the effects of aging and vascular compromise on cerebral WM, in an

	We demonstrate a powerful method of comparing complex shapes in 3-dimensions

	questions. Pairs of virtual endocasts (VEs) created from high-resolution
	CT scans of corresponding latex/plaster endocasts and their associated

	sapiens and two Pan troglodytes specimens. Distances between each
	cranial VE and its corresponding latex/plaster VE were then mapped
	on a voxel-by-voxel basis. The results show that between 79.7\% and
	91.0\% of the voxels in the four latex/plaster VEs are within 2 mm
	of their corresponding cranial VEs surfaces. The average error is
	relatively small, and variation in the pattern of error across the
	surfaces appears to be generally random overall. However, inferior
	areas around the cranial base and the temporal poles were somewhat
	overestimated in both human and chimpanzee specimens, and the area
	overlaying Broca's area in humans was somewhat underestimated. This

  abstract = {This paper presents a family of projected descent direction algorithms
	with inexact line search for solving large-scale minimization problems
	subject to simple bounds on the decision variables. The global convergence
	of algorithms in this family is ensured by conditions on the descent
	directions and line search. Whenever a sequence constructed by an
	algorithm in this family enters a sufficiently small neighborhood
	of a local minimizer ? satisfying standard second-order sufficiency
	conditions, it gets trapped and converges to this local minimizer.
	Furthermore, in this case, the active constraint set at ? is identified
	in a finite number of iterations. This fact is used to ensure that
	the rate of convergence to a local minimizer, satisfying standard
	second-order sufficiency conditions, depends only on the behavior

  abstract = {Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is a clinically, genetically
	and pathologically heterogeneous disorder. Within FTLD with ubiquitin-positive
	inclusions (FTLD-U), a new pathological subtype named FTLD-FUS was
	recently found with fused in sarcoma (FUS) positive, TDP-43-negative
	inclusions, and striking atrophy of the caudate nucleus. The aim
	of this study was to determine the frequency of FTLD-FUS in our pathological
	FTLD series, and to describe the clinical, neuroimaging and neuropathological
	features of FTLD-FUS, especially caudate atrophy. Demographic and
	clinical data collected prospectively from 387 patients with frontotemporal
	dementia (FTD) yielded 74 brain specimens. Immunostaining was carried
	out using a panel of antibodies, including AT-8, ubiquitin, p62,
	FUS, and TDP-43. Cortical and caudate atrophy on MRI (n = 136) was
	rated as normal, mild-moderate or severe. Of the 37 FTLD-U cases,
	33 were reclassified as FTLD-TDP and four (0.11, 95\%: 0.00-0.21)
	as FTLD-FUS, with ubiquitin and FUS-positive, p62 and TDP-43-negative
	neuronal intranuclear inclusions (NII). All four FTLD-FUS cases had
	a negative family history, behavioural variant FTD (bvFTD), and three
	had an age at onset <or=40 years. MRI revealed mild-moderate or severe
	caudate atrophy in all, with a mean duration from onset till MRI
	of 63 months (range 16-119 months). In our total clinical FTD cohort,
	we found 11 patients (0.03; 95\% CI: 0.01-0.05) with bvFTD, negative
	family history, and age at onset <or=40 years. Caudate atrophy was
	present in 10 out of 136 MRIs, and included all four FUS-cases. The
	newly identified FTLD-FUS has a frequency of 11\% in FTLD-U, and
	an estimated frequency of three percent in our clinical FTD cohort.
	The existence of this pathological subtype can be predicted with
	reasonable certainty by age at onset <or=40 years, negative family
	history, bvFTD and caudate atrophy on MRI.},

  abstract = {Frontotemporal dementia is accompanied by motor neuron disease (FTD
	+ MND) in approximately 10\% of cases. There is accumulating evidence
	for a clinicopathological overlap between FTD and MND based on observations
	of familial aggregation and neuropathological findings of ubiquitin-positive
	neuronal cytoplasmatic inclusions (NCI) in lower motor neurons, hippocampus
	and neocortex in both conditions. Several familial forms exist with
	different genetic loci and defects. We investigated the familial
	aggregation and clinical presentation of FTD + MND cases in a large
	cohort of 368 FTD patients in The Netherlands. Immunohistochemistry
	of available brain tissue of deceased patients was investigated using
	a panel of antibodies including ubiquitin, p62 and TAR DNA-binding
	protein of 43 kDa antibodies. A total of eight patients coming from
	six families had a family history positive for FTD + MND (mean age
	at onset 53.2 +/- 8.4 years). Five patients presented with behavioural
	changes and cognitive changes followed by motor neuron disease, whereas
	symptoms of motor neuron disease were the presenting features in
	the remaining three patients. Other affected relatives in these families
	showed dementia/FTD, MND or FTD + MND reflecting the clinical interfamilial
	variation. No mutations were identified in any of the candidate genes,
	including Superoxide Dismutase 1, dynactin, angiogenin, Microtubule-Associated
	Protein Tau, valosin-containing protein and progranulin. Available
	brain tissue of five patients with familial FTD + MND showed NCI
	in hippocampus, neocortex and spinal cord in all, and neuronal intranuclear
	inclusions (NII) in two brains. TDP-43 antibody showed robust staining
	of neuronal inclusions similar in distribution and morphology to
	NCI and NII. Additionally, TDP-43 antibody also stained ubiquitin-negative
	glial inclusions in the basal striatum of one case. In conclusion,
	there exists considerable clinical variation within families with
	FTD + MND, which may be determined by other genetic or environmental
	factors. NII are also found in some cases of familial FTD + MND without
	Progranulin mutations. The observation of glial TDP-43 positive inclusions
	in one brain is very interesting, although their pathophysiological
	significance is yet unknown.},

	show focal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and orbital frontoinsula

	FI, though sometimes considered ancient in phylogeny, feature a large

	network involved in episodic memory retrieval. These divergent patterns
	of functional and regional impairment remain mysterious despite extensive
	molecular-level characterization of bvFTD and AD. In this report,
	we further develop the hypothesis that VENs drive the regional vulnerability
	pattern seen in bvFTD, citing recent evidence from functional imaging
	in healthy humans, and also structural imaging and quantitative neuropathology
	data from bvFTD and AD. Our most recent findings suggest that bvFTD
	and AD target distinct, anticorrelated intrinsic connectivity networks

	We suggest that the regional and neuronal vulnerability patterns
	seen in bvFTD and AD underlie the divergent impact of these disorders
	on recently evolved social-emotional functions.},

	on a spatiotemporal memory procedure (delayed response [DR]) that

  abstract = {Loss of function mutations in progranulin cause tau-negative frontotemporal
	lobar degeneration with ubiquitin-positive inclusions. A major protein
	component of these inclusions is TDP-43, which becomes hyperphosphorylated,
	ubiquitinated, and cleaved to generate C-terminal fragments, which
	apparently translocate from nuclei to the cytoplasm. Most progranulin
	mutations are nonsense mutations resulting in nonsense-mediated mRNA
	decay and consequently reduced progranulin protein levels. However,
	some missense mutations are described that occur within the signal
	sequence and mature progranulin. We now demonstrate that a progranulin
	mutation located within the signal sequence (PGRN A9D) results in
	cytoplasmic missorting with extremely low expression. In contrast,
	two other progranulin mutations (PGRN P248L and R432C) are expressed
	as immature proteins but are inefficiently transported through and
	partially degraded within the secretory pathway, resulting in a significantly
	reduced secretion. Thus apparently all progranulin mutations cause
	reduced protein expression or secretion, although by different cellular
	mechanisms. To investigate a putative relationship between reduced
	expression of progranulin and TDP-43 relocalization and deposition,
	we down-regulated progranulin in human cell lines and in zebrafish.
	Upon reduction of progranulin, neither a major redistribution of
	TDP-43 nor proteolytic processing to disease-characterizing C-terminal
	fragments could be observed.},

  abstract = {Neurodegenerative diseases often cause focal damage to brain structures
	mediating social cognition and personality, resulting in altered
	interpersonal communication and behavior. We review recent research
	describing this phenomenon in various aspects of social cognition.Corresponding
	to their pervasive socioemotional deficits, patients with frontotemporal
	dementia perform poorly on laboratory-based tasks including recognizing
	emotions, attending to salient information that guides social behavior,
	representing social knowledge, comprehending others' mental states,
	and maintaining insight to their own difficulties. Together with
	poor executive and regulation mechanisms, these social cognition
	deficits ultimately impact behavior. Patients with logopenic and
	nonfluent primary progressive aphasia have some deficits recognizing
	emotional prosody, whereas those with the semantic variant show more
	widespread deficits in social comprehension. Although Alzheimer's
	disease patients perform poorly on some social cognition tasks, this
	typically reflects general cognitive impairment, and their real-life
	social functioning is less affected than in diseases targeting frontotemporal
	structures. Studies in motor diseases such as Parkinson's suggest
	some degradation of emotion recognition and social comprehension,
	which should be investigated further.We summarize recent findings
	concerning perception and evaluation of socioemotional information,
	social knowledge storage and access, advanced information processing
	mechanisms, and behavioral response selection and regulation across
	various neurodegenerative diseases.},

	and can be considered topologically spherical if it is closed at
	the brain stem. Low-level segmentation of magnetic resonance {(MR)}
	imagery typically produces cerebral volumes whose tessellations are
	not topologically spherical. We present a novel algorithm that analyzes
	and constrains the topology of a volumetric object. Graphs are formed
	that represent the connectivity of voxel segments in the foreground
	and background of the image. These graphs are analyzed and minimal
	corrections to the volume are made prior to tessellation. We apply
	the algorithm to a simple test object and to cerebral white matter
	masks generated by a low-level tissue identification sequence. We
	tessellate the resulting objects using the marching cubes algorithm
	and verify their topology by computing their Euler characteristics.
	A key benefit of the algorithm is that it localizes the change to
	a volume to the specific areas of its topological defects.},

  abstract = {Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease
	of motor neurons that results in progressive weakness and death from
	respiratory failure, commonly within about 3 years. Previous studies
	have shown association of a locus on chromosome 9p with ALS and linkage
	with ALS-frontotemporal dementia. We aimed to test whether this genomic
	region is also associated with ALS in an independent set of UK samples,
	and to identify risk factors associated with ALS in a further genome-wide
	association study that combined data from the independent analysis
	with those from other countries.We collected samples from patients
	with sporadic ALS from 20 UK hospitals and obtained UK control samples
	from the control groups of the Depression Case Control study, the
	Bipolar Affective Case Control Study, and the British 1958 birth
	cohort DNA collection. Genotyping of DNA in this independent analysis
	was done with Illumina HumanHap550 BeadChips. We then undertook a
	joint genome-wide analysis that combined data from the independent
	set with published data from the UK, USA, Netherlands, Ireland, Italy,
	France, Sweden, and Belgium. The threshold for significance was p=0·05
	in the independent analysis, because we were interested in replicating
	a small number of previously reported associations, whereas the Bonferroni-corrected
	threshold for significance in the joint analysis was p=2·20?10(-7)After
	quality control, samples were available from 599 patients and 4144
	control individuals in the independent set. In this analysis, two
	single nucleotide polymorphisms in a locus on chromosome 9p21.2 were
	associated with ALS: rs3849942 (p=2·22?10(-6); odds ratio [OR] 1·39,
	95\% CI 1·21-1·59) and rs2814707 (p=3·32?10(-6); 1·38, 1·20-1·58).
	In the joint analysis, which included samples from 4312 patients
	with ALS and 8425 control individuals, rs3849942 (p=4·64?10(-10);
	OR 1·22, 95\% CI 1·15-1·30) and rs2814707 (p=4·72?10(-10); 1·22,
	1·15-1·30) were associated with ALS.We have found strong evidence
	of a genetic association of two single nucleotide polymorphisms on
	chromosome 9 with sporadic ALS, in line with findings from previous
	independent GWAS of ALS and linkage studies of ALS-frontotemporal
	dementia. Our findings together with these earlier findings suggest
	that genetic variation at this locus on chromosome 9 causes sporadic
	ALS and familial ALS-frontotemporal dementia. Resequencing studies
	and then functional analysis should be done to identify the defective
	gene.},

  abstract = {Principal component analysis {(PCA)} is a widely used tool for data
	analysis and dimension reduction in applications throughout science
	and engineering. However, the principal components {(PCs)} can sometimes
	be difficult to interpret, because they are linear combinations of
	all the original variables. To facilitate interpretation, sparse
	{PCA} produces modified {PCs} with sparse loadings, i.e. loadings
	with very few non-zero elements. In this paper, we propose a new
	sparse {PCA} method, namely sparse {PCA} via regularized {SVD} {(sPCA-rSVD).}
	We use the connection of {PCA} with singular value decomposition
	{(SVD)} of the data matrix and extract the {PCs} through solving
	a low rank matrix approximation problem. Regularization penalties
	are introduced to the corresponding minimization problem to promote
	sparsity in {PC} loadings. An efficient iterative algorithm is proposed
	for computation. Two tuning parameter selection methods are discussed.
	Some theoretical results are established to justify the use of {sPCA-rSVD}
	when only the data covariance matrix is available. In addition, we
	give a modified definition of variance explained by the sparse {PCs.}
	The {sPCA-rSVD} provides a uniform treatment of both classical multivariate
	data and high-dimension-low-sample-size {(HDLSS)} data. Further understanding
	of {sPCA-rSVD} and some existing alternatives is gained through simulation
	studies and real data examples, which suggests that {sPCA-rSVD} provides
	competitive results. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	modes are representative of variations within the training data,
	they are not necessarily discriminative on labeled data or relevant
	to the differences between the subpopulations. We use the shape descriptors
	from SSM as features to classify AD from normal control (NC) cases.
	In this study, a Hotelling's T2 test is performed to select a subset
	of landmarks which are used in PCA. The resulting variation modes
	are used as predictors of AD from NC. The discrimination ability
	of these predictors is evaluated in terms of their classification
	performances with bagged support vector machines (SVMs). Restricting
	the model to landmarks with better separation between AD and NC increases
	the discrimination power of SSM. The predictors extracted on the
	subregions also showed stronger correlation with the memory-related
	measurements such as Logical Memory, Auditory Verbal Learning Test
	(AVLT) and the memory subscores of Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale
	(ADAS).},

  abstract = {Mechanical stress affects and regulates many aspects of the cell,
	including morphology, growth, differentiation, gene expression and
	apoptosis. In this study we show how mechanical stress perturbs the
	intracellular structures of the cell and induces mechanical responses.
	In order to correlate mechanical perturbations to cellular responses,
	we used a combined fluorescence-atomic force microscope {(AFM)} to
	produce well defined nanomechanical perturbations of 10 {nN} while
	simultaneously tracking the real-time motion of fluorescently labelled
	mitochondria in live cells. The spatial displacement of the organelles
	in response to applied loads demonstrates the highly dynamic mechanical
	response of mitochondria in fibroblast cells. The average displacement
	of all mitochondrial structures analysed showed an increase of approximately
	40\%, post-perturbation ( approximately 160 nm in comparison to basal
	displacements of approximately 110 nm). These results show that local
	forces can produce organelle displacements at locations far from
	the initial point of contact (up to approximately 40 microm). In
	order to examine the role of the cytoskeleton in force transmission
	and its effect on mitochondrial displacements, both the actin and
	microtubule cytoskeleton were disrupted using Cytochalasin D and
	Nocodazole, respectively. Our results show that there is no significant
	change in mitochondrial displacement following indentation after
	such treatments. These results demonstrate the role of the cytoskeleton
	in force transmission through the cell and on mitochondrial displacements.
	In addition, it is suggested that care must be taken when performing
	mechanical experiments on living cells with the {AFM}, as these local
	mechanical perturbations may have significant structural and even
	biochemical effects on the cell.},

	investigating the hypothesis that changes in neural connectivity
	relate to cognitive impairment in children with the disorder.Whole
	brain analyses of multiple measures computed from diffusion tensor
	image data acquired from the brains of children with the disorder
	and typically developing controls. We also correlated diffusion tensor
	data with performance on a visuospatial cognitive task that taps
	spatial attention.Analyses revealed four common clusters, in the
	parietal and frontal lobes, that showed complementary patterns of
	connectivity in children with the deletion and typical controls.
	We interpreted these results as indicating differences in connective
	complexity to adjoining cortical regions that are critical to the
	cognitive functions in which affected children show impairments.
	Strong, and similarly opposing patterns of correlations between diffusion
	values in those clusters and spatial attention performance measures
	considerably strengthened that interpretation.Our results suggest
	that atypical development of connective patterns in the brains of
	children with chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome indicate a neuropathology

  abstract = {There is increasing evidence that frontotemporal dementia and amyotrophic
	lateral sclerosis are part of a disease continuum. Recently, a hexanucleotide
	repeat expansion in C9orf72 was identified as a major cause of both
	sporadic and familial frontotemporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral
	sclerosis. The aim of this study was to investigate clinical and
	neuropathological characteristics of hexanucleotide repeat expansions
	in C9orf72 in a large cohort of Dutch patients with frontotemporal
	dementia. Repeat expansions were successfully determined in a cohort
	of 353 patients with sporadic or familial frontotemporal dementia
	with or without amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and 522 neurologically
	normal controls. Immunohistochemistry was performed in a series of
	10 brains from patients carrying expanded repeats using a panel of
	antibodies. In addition, the presence of RNA containing GGGGCC repeats
	in paraffin-embedded sections of post-mortem brain tissue was investigated
	using fluorescence in situ hybridization with a locked nucleic acid
	probe targeting the GGGGCC repeat. Hexanucleotide repeat expansions
	in C9orf72 were found in 37 patients with familial (28.7\%) and five
	with sporadic frontotemporal dementia (2.2\%). The mean age at onset
	was 56.9 ± 8.3 years (range 39-76), and disease duration 7.6 ± 4.6
	years (range 1-22). The clinical phenotype of these patients varied
	between the behavioural variant of frontotemporal dementia (n = 34)
	and primary progressive aphasia (n = 8), with concomitant amyotrophic
	lateral sclerosis in seven patients. Predominant temporal atrophy
	on neuroimaging was present in 13 of 32 patients. Pathological examination
	of the 10 brains from patients carrying expanded repeats revealed
	frontotemporal lobar degeneration with neuronal transactive response
	DNA binding protein-positive inclusions of variable type, size and
	morphology in all brains. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis
	of brain material from patients with the repeat expansion, a microtubule-associated
	protein tau or a progranulin mutation, and controls did not show
	RNA-positive inclusions specific for brains with the GGGGCC repeat
	expansion. The hexanucleotide repeat expansion in C9orf72 is an important
	cause of frontotemporal dementia with and without amyotrophic lateral
	sclerosis, and is sometimes associated with primary progressive aphasia.
	Neuropathological hallmarks include neuronal and glial inclusions,
	and dystrophic neurites containing transactive response DNA binding
	protein. Future studies are needed to explain the wide variation
	in clinical presentation.},

	PGRN genetic variability in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS),

	exons, exon-intron boundaries, and 5' and 3' regulatory regions of
	PGRN in a Belgian sample of 230 patients with ALS. The frequency

	individuals. The contribution of eight frequent polymorphisms to
	ALS risk, onset age, and survival was assessed in an association
	study in the Belgian sample and a replication series of 308 Dutch
	patients with ALS and 345 Dutch controls.In patients with ALS we
	identified 11 mutations, 5 of which were predicted to affect PGRN
	protein sequence or levels (four missense mutations and one 5' regulatory
	variant). Moreover, common variants (rs9897526, rs34424835, and rs850713)
	and haplotypes were significantly associated with a reduction in
	age at onset and a shorter survival after onset of ALS in both the
	Belgian and the Dutch studies.PGRN acts as a modifier of the course
	of disease in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, through
	earlier onset and shorter survival.},

	State Examination ({M}{M}{S}{E}) items in predicting incidence of
	{A}lzheimer's disease (AD). In addition, 3-year longitudinal changes
	in {M}{M}{S}{E} items were contrasted between incident AD and nondemented
	persons. METHODS: A population-based group of very old adults, 75-95
	years of age, were followed longitudinally. Of the original 327 participants,
	32 were diagnosed with probable or possible AD after a 3-year follow-up
	interval and 189 remained nondemented. Cognitive performance was
	indexed by the individual item scores from the {M}{M}{S}{E}. These
	sample from multiple domains of cognitive functioning, including
	visuospatial skill, recent memory, orientation to time and place,
	language, and the ability to sustain attention. RESULTS: Items dealing
	with delayed episodic memory and orientation to time were significant
	predictors of AD incidence, independent of age, gender, and years
	of education, as determined by logistic regression analyses. Longitudinally,
	changes in performance were largest among individuals diagnosed as
	incident AD, although the magnitude of change across items was highly
	variable. In particular, decline was relatively small for the delayed
	memory item, whereas most other measures showed dramatic decline
	in performance among individuals with incident AD. CONCLUSIONS: Individual
	{M}{M}{S}{E} items, especially those with some type of episodic memory
	referent, were the best predictors of incident cases of AD. Moreover,
	{M}{M}{S}{E} items displayed differential rates of changes, particularly
	for the incident AD participants.},

	gene as the cause of chromosome 9-linked frontotemporal dementia
	and motor neuron disease offers the opportunity for greater understanding
	of the relationship between these disorders and other clinical forms
	of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. In this study, we screened
	a cohort of 398 patients with frontotemporal dementia, progressive
	non-fluent aphasia, semantic dementia or mixture of these syndromes
	for mutations in the C9ORF72 gene. Motor neuron disease was present
	in 55 patients (14\%). We identified 32 patients with C9ORF72 mutations,
	representing 8\% of the cohort. The patients' clinical phenotype
	at presentation varied: nine patients had frontotemporal dementia
	with motor neuron disease, 19 had frontotemporal dementia alone,
	one had mixed semantic dementia with frontal features and three had
	progressive non-fluent aphasia. There was, as expected, a significant
	association between C9ORF72 mutations and presence of motor neuron
	disease. Nevertheless, 46 patients, including 22 familial, had motor
	neuron disease but no mutation in C9ORF72. Thirty-eight per cent
	of the patients with C9ORF72 mutations presented with psychosis,
	with a further 28\% exhibiting paranoid, deluded or irrational thinking,
	whereas <4\% of non-mutation bearers presented similarly. The presence
	of psychosis dramatically increased the odds that patients carried
	the mutation. Mutation bearers showed a low incidence of motor stereotypies,
	and relatively high incidence of complex repetitive behaviours, largely
	linked to patients' delusions. They also showed a lower incidence
	of acquired sweet food preference than patients without C9ORF72 mutations.
	Post-mortem pathology in five patients revealed transactive response
	DNA-binding protein 43 pathology, type A in one patient and type
	B in three. However, one patient had corticobasal degeneration pathology.
	The findings indicate that C9ORF72 mutations cause some but not all
	cases of frontotemporal dementia with motor neuron disease. Other
	mutations remain to be discovered. C9ORF72 mutations are associated
	with variable clinical presentations and pathology. Nevertheless,
	the findings highlight a powerful association between C9ORF72 mutations
	and psychosis and suggest that the behavioural characteristics of
	patients with C9ORF72 mutations are qualitatively distinct. Mutations
	in the C9ORF72 gene may be a major cause not only of frontotemporal
	dementia with motor neuron disease but also of late onset psychosis.},

  abstract = {Accuracy of clinical diagnosis of dementia is increasingly important
	for therapeutic and scientific investigations. In this study, we
	examine diagnostic accuracy in a consecutive series of 228 patients
	referred to a specialist early-onset dementia clinic, whose brains
	were subsequently examined at post-mortem. Diagnosis was based on
	structured history, neurological examination and neuropsychological
	assessment, with emphasis on qualitative as well as quantitative
	aspects of performance. Neuroimaging provided support for but did
	not alter the clinical diagnosis. We set out the principles that
	guided diagnosis: (i) time course of illness; (ii) weighting of physical,
	behavioural and cognitive symptoms and signs; (iii) 'anterior' versus
	'posterior' hemisphere character of cognitive change; and (iv) specificity
	of deficit, paying attention to the differentiation between syndromes
	of frontotemporal lobar degeneration and focal forms of Alzheimer's
	disease. Forty-two per cent of the patients had clinical diagnoses
	of one of the syndromes of frontotemporal lobar degeneration, the
	high proportion reflecting the research interests of the group. Forty-six
	per cent were diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and the remaining
	patients, dementia with Lewy bodies, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, vascular
	or unclassified dementia. Frontotemporal lobar degeneration was identified
	with 100\% sensitivity and 97\% specificity and Alzheimer's disease
	with 97\% sensitivity and 100\% specificity. Patients with other
	pathologies were accurately identified on clinical grounds. Examination
	of subsyndromes of frontotemporal lobar degeneration showed a relatively
	predictable relationship between clinical diagnosis and pathological
	subtype. Whereas the behavioural disorder of frontotemporal dementia
	was associated with tau, transactive response DNA binding protein
	43 and fused-in-sarcoma pathology, cases of frontotemporal dementia
	with motoneuron disease, semantic dementia and, with one exception,
	progressive non-fluent aphasia were associated with transactive response
	DNA binding protein 43 pathology, distinguished by ubiquitin subtyping
	(types B, C and A, respectively). Clinical diagnoses of progressive
	apraxia, corticobasal degeneration and progressive supranuclear palsy
	were, with one exception, associated with Pick, corticobasal and
	progressive supranuclear palsy subtypes of tau pathology, respectively.
	Unanticipated findings included Alzheimer pathology in two patients
	presenting with the behavioural syndrome of frontotemporal dementia
	and corticobasal pathology in four others with clinical frontotemporal
	dementia. Notwithstanding such anomalies, which serve as a reminder
	that there is not an absolute concordance between clinical phenotype
	and underlying pathology, the findings show that dementias can be
	distinguished in life with a high level of accuracy. Moreover, careful
	clinical phenotyping allows prediction of histopathological subtype
	of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. The principles guiding diagnosis
	provide the foundation for future prospective studies.},

  abstract = {Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a neurodegenerative dementia
	syndrome principally characterized by the gradual dissolution of
	language functions, especially in the early stages of disorder. In
	a previous functional neuroimaging study, PPA patients were found
	to activate core language areas similarly to control subjects when
	performing semantic and phonological processing tasks (Sonty et al.,
	2003). In the present study, functional magnetic resonance imaging
	(f{M}{R}{I}) and dynamic causal modeling (DCM) were used to study
	multiregional effective connectivity in early-stage PPA (n = 8) and
	control (n = 8) subjects performing semantic word matching and visual
	letter matching tasks. f{M}{R}{I} analysis showed semantic task-specific
	activations in the left inferior frontal (Broca's area) and posterior
	superior temporal (Wernicke's area) regions, in addition to other
	language regions, in both groups. Using a model language network
	consisting of six left hemisphere regions, the DCM analysis demonstrated
	reduced language-specific effective connectivity between Wernicke's
	and Broca's areas in the PPA patient group. Furthermore, this decrement
	in connectivity was predictive of semantic task accuracy. These results
	demonstrate for the first time that dysfunctional network interactions
	(effective connectivity), rather than hypoactivity within individual
	brain regions, may contribute to the emergence of language deficits
	seen in PPA.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To resolve and regularize orientation estimates for two
	crossing fibers from images acquired with conventional diffusion
	tensor imaging (DTI) sampling schemes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Partial
	volume causes artifacts in DTI. Given that routine use of high angular
	resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) is still tentative, a regularized
	two-tensor model to resolve fiber crossings from conventional DTI
	datasets is presented. To overcome the problems of fitting multiple
	tensors, a model that exploits the planar diffusion profile in regions
	with fiber crossings is utilized. A regularization scheme is applied
	to reduce noise artifacts, which can be significant due to the relatively
	low number of acquired images. A set of basis directions is used
	to convert the two tensor model to many models of lower dimensionality.
	Relaxation labeling is utilized to select from amongst these models
	those that preserve continuity of orientations across neighbors.
	Revised fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) values
	are computed. RESULTS: Spatial regularization improves the orientation
	estimates of the two-tensor model in simulations and in human data
	and estimates agree well with a priori anatomical knowledge. CONCLUSION:
	Orientational, anisotropy, and diffusivity information can be resolved
	in regions of two fiber crossings using full brain coverage scans
	acquired in less than six minutes.},

	a symptomathology that has led investigators to name the disease
	"Frontotemporal Dementia and Parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17."
	Neuropathologically, these patients present with atrophy of frontal
	and temporal cortex as well as of basal ganglia and substantia nigra.
	In the majority of cases these features are accompanied by neuronal
	loss, gliosis and microtubule-associated protein tau deposits which
	can be present in both neurones and glial cells. The distribution,
	structural and biochemical characteristics of the tau deposits differentiate
	them from those present in Alzheimer's disease, corticobasal degeneration,
	progressive supranuclear palsy and Pick's disease. No beta-amyloid
	deposits are present. The clinical and neuropathological features
	of the disease in these families suggest that Frontotemporal Dementia
	and Parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 is a distinct disorder.
	The presence of abundant tau deposits in the majority of these families

	pathology. It belongs to the group of familial frontotemporal dementias

	We now report a G to A transition in the intron following exon 10
	of the gene for microtubule-associated protein tau in familial MSTD.
	The mutation is located at the 3' neighboring nucleotide of the GT
	splice-donor site and disrupts a predicted stem-loop structure. We
	also report an abnormal preponderance of soluble tau protein isoforms
	with four microtubule-binding repeats over isoforms with three repeats
	in familial MSTD. This most likely accounts for our previous finding
	that sarkosyl-insoluble tau protein extracted from the filamentous
	deposits in familial MSTD consists only of tau isoforms with four
	repeats. These findings reveal that a departure from the normal ratio
	of four-repeat to three-repeat tau isoforms leads to the formation
	of abnormal tau filaments. The results show that dysregulation of

	short-term memory deficit. Memory impairment was present at the onset
	in 15 patients, with word finding difficulties and stereotyped speech
	also being common. Parkinsonism was first noted 3 years after the
	onset of symptoms. Neuroimaging showed the most extensive grey matter
	loss in the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus and frontal operculum/insular
	cortex of the right hemisphere and, to a lesser extent, in the anterior
	cingulate gyrus, head of the caudate nucleus and the posterolateral

	glial deposits consisting mostly of 4-repeat tau were present in
	frontal, cingulate, temporal and insular cortices, white matter,
	hippocampus, parahippocampus, basal ganglia, selected brainstem nuclei
	and spinal cord. Tau haplotyping indicated that specific haplotypes
	of the wild-type allele may act as modifiers of disease presentation.
	Quantitative neuroimaging has been used to analyse the progression
	of atrophy in affected individuals and for predicting disease onset
	in an asymptomatic mutation carrier. This multidisciplinary study
	provides a comprehensive description of the natural history of disease

	features of Alzheimer's disease (AD). There is some debate as to
	which neuropathological feature comes first in the disease process,
	with early autopsy studies suggesting that NFT develop first, and
	more recent neuroimaging studies supporting the early role of amyloid
	beta (A?) deposition. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of A???
	and hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) have been shown to serve as in
	vivo proxy measures of amyloid plaques and NFT, respectively. The
	aim of this study was to examine the association between CSF biomarkers
	and rate of atrophy in the precuneus and hippocampus. These regions
	were selected because the precuneus appears to be affected early
	and severely by A? deposition, and the hippocampus similarly by NFT
	pathology. We predicted (1) baseline A??? would be related to accelerated
	rate of cortical thinning in the precuneus and volume loss in the
	hippocampus, with the latter relationship expected to be weaker,
	(2) baseline p-tau(181p) would be related to accelerated rate of
	hippocampal atrophy and cortical thinning in the precuneus, with
	the latter relationship expected to be weaker. Using all ADNI cohorts,
	we fitted separate linear mixed-effects models for changes in hippocampus
	and precuneus longitudinal outcome measures with baseline CSF biomarkers
	modeled as predictors. Results partially supported our hypotheses:
	Both baseline p-tau(181p) and A??? were associated with hippocampal
	atrophy over time. Neither p-tau(181p) nor A??? were significantly
	related to cortical thinning in the precuneus over time. However,
	follow-up analyses demonstrated that having abnormal levels of both
	A??? and p-tau(181p) was associated with an accelerated rate of atrophy
	in both the hippocampus and precuneus. Results support early effects
	of A? in the Alzheimer's disease process, which are less apparent
	than and perhaps dependent on p-tau effects as the disease progresses.
	However, amyloid deposition alone may be insufficient for emergence
	of significant morphometric changes and clinical symptoms.},

  abstract = {{CONTEXT}
	
	Several neurobiological models of obsessive-compulsive disorder {(OCD)}
	posit a primary role for dysfunction of the anterior cingulate gyrus.
	Both functional and structural neuroimaging studies have implicated
	anterior cingulate gray matter abnormalities in the pathophysiology
	of {OCD}, but there has been little investigation of the anterior
	cingulate white matter in this disorder.
	
	
	{OBJECTIVE}
	
	To test the hypothesis that patients with {OCD} have abnormal white
	matter microstructure in the anterior cingulate gyrus compared with
	healthy volunteers as inferred from diffusion tensor imaging. Additional
	analyses examined group differences in white matter integrity across
	the entire brain.
	
	
	{DESIGN}, {SETTING}, {AND} {PARTICIPANTS}
	
	Fifteen patients with a {DSM-IV} diagnosis of {OCD} and 15 healthy
	volunteers matched for age, sex, and handedness underwent diffusion
	tensor imaging and structural magnetic resonance imaging examinations.
	Fractional anisotropy {(FA)}, a robust intravoxel measure of water
	self-diffusion, was compared between groups on a voxel-by-voxel basis
	in the anterior cingulate white matter after standardization in Talairach
	space.
	
	
	{MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES}
	
	Clinical ratings of symptom severity (ie, Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive
	Scale) and {FA.}
	
	
	{RESULTS}
	
	Compared with healthy volunteers, patients demonstrated significantly
	lower {FA} bilaterally in 3 areas of the anterior cingulate gyrus
	white matter. Additional analyses conducted across the rest of the
	brain white matter revealed lower {FA} bilaterally in the parietal
	region (supramarginal gyri), right posterior cingulate gyrus, and
	left occipital lobe (lingual gyrus). No areas of significantly higher
	{FA} were observed in patients compared with healthy volunteers.
	Lower {FA} in the parietal region correlated significantly with higher
	Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale scores.
	
	
	{CONCLUSIONS}
	
	These preliminary findings provide evidence of an abnormality that
	involves the anterior cingulate white matter in the pathogenesis
	of {OCD} and are consistent with neurobiological models that posit
	a defect in connectivity in the anterior cingulate basal ganglia-thalamocortical
	circuit. White matter abnormalities in other brain regions may also
	be implicated in the neurobiology of {OCD.}},

	detect specific pattern of brain atrophy in Alzheimer's disease {(AD)},
	but it still lacks an established model to derive the individual
	risk of {AD} in at-risk subjects, such as patients with mild cognitive
	impairment {(MCI).} We applied principal component analysis to deformation
	maps derived from {MRI} scans of 32 {AD} patients, 18 elderly healthy
	controls and 24 {MCI} patients. Principal component scores were used
	to discriminate between {AD} patients and controls and between {MCI}
	converters and {MCI} non-converters. We found a significant regional
	pattern of atrophy (p {\textless} 0.001) in medial temporal lobes,
	neocortical association areas, thalamus and basal ganglia and corresponding
	widening of cerebrospinal fluid {(CSF)} spaces (p {\textless} 0.001)
	in {AD} patients compared to controls. Accuracy was 81\% for {CSF-}
	and 83\% for brain-based deformation maps to separate {AD} patients
	from controls. Nine out of 24 {MCI} patients converted to {AD} during
	clinical follow-up. Discrimination between {MCI} converters and non-converters
	reached 80\% accuracy based on {CSF} maps and 73\% accuracy based
	on brain maps. In a logistic regression model, principal component
	scores based on {CSF} maps predicted clinical outcome in {MCI} patients
	even after controlling for age, gender, {MMSE} score and time of
	follow-up. Our findings indicate that multivariate network analysis
	of deformation maps detects typical features of {AD} pathology and
	provides a powerful tool to predict conversion into {AD} in non-demented

	situated within the membranes. We illustrate this concept by an analogy

	traditional ones, based on attraction, with an intermediate step
	being optical flow techniques. We use the concept of diffusing models
	to derive three different non-rigid matching algorithms, one using
	all the intensity levels in the static image, one using only contour

	sequence as the disease progressed, mirroring the sequence of neurofibrillary
	tangle accumulation observed in cross sections at autopsy. Advancing
	deficits were visualized as dynamic maps that change over time. Frontal
	regions, spared early in the disease, showed pervasive deficits later
	(>15\% loss). The maps distinguished different phases of {A}{D} and

	is designed for problems with features that can be ordered in some
	meaningful way. The fused lasso penalizes the L1-norm of both the
	coefficients and their successive differences. Thus it encourages
	sparsity of the coefficients and also sparsity of their differences—i.e.
	local constancy of the coefficient profile. The fused lasso is especially
	useful when the number of features p is much greater than N, the
	sample size. The technique is also extended to the ‘hinge’ loss function
	that underlies the support vector classifier. We illustrate the methods
	on examples from protein mass spectroscopy and gene expression data.},

  abstract = {This study investigated the role of visuospatial tasks in identifying
	cognitive decline in patients with {A}lzheimer's disease (AD), by
	correlating neuropsychological performance with cerebral perfusion
	measures. There were 157 participants: 29 neurologically healthy
	controls (age: 70.3 +/- 6.6, {M}{M}{S}{E} > or = 27), 86 patients
	with mild AD (age: 69.18 +/- 8.28, {M}{M}{S}{E} > or = 21) and 42
	patients moderate/severe AD (age: 68.86 +/- 10.69, {M}{M}{S}{E} 8-20).
	Single Photon Emission Computerized Tomography (SPECT) was used to
	derive regional perfusion ratios, and correlated using partial least
	squares (PLS) with neuropsychological test scores from the Benton
	Line Orientation (BLO) and the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure (RO).
	Cross-sectional analysis demonstrated that mean scores differed in
	accordance with disease status: control group (BLO 25.5, RO 33.3);
	mild AD (BLO 20.1, RO 25.5); moderate/severe AD (BLO 10.7, RO 16).
	Correlations were observed between BLO/RO and right parietal SPECT
	regions in the AD groups. Visuospatial performance, often undersampled
	in cognitive batteries for AD, is clearly impaired even in mild AD
	and correlates with functional deficits as indexed by cerebral perfusion
	ratios on SPECT implicating right hemisphere circuits. Furthermore,
	PLS reveals that usual spatial tasks probe a distributed brain network
	in both hemispheres including many areas targeted by early AD pathology.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present a statistical parts-based model {(PBM)}
	of appearance, applied to the problem of modeling intersubject anatomical
	variability in magnetic resonance {(MR)} brain images. In contrast
	to global image models such as the active appearance model {(AAM)},
	the {PBM} consists of a collection of localized image regions, referred
	to as parts, whose appearance, geometry and occurrence frequency
	are quantified statistically. The parts-based approach explicitly
	addresses the case where one-to-one correspondence does not exist
	between all subjects in a population due to anatomical differences,
	as model parts are not required to appear in all subjects. The model
	is constructed through a fully automatic machine learning algorithm,
	identifying image patterns that appear with statistical regularity
	in a large collection of subject images. Parts are represented by
	generic scale-invariant features, and the model can, therefore, be
	applied to a wide variety of image domains. Experimentation based
	on 2-D {MR} slices shows that a {PBM} learned from a set of 102 subjects
	can be robustly fit to 50 new subjects with accuracy comparable to
	3 human raters. Additionally, it is shown that unlike global models
	such as the {AAM}, {PBM} fitting is stable in the presence of unexpected,

	the water diffusion characteristics of the corticospinal tracts in
	21 patients with {ALS} and 14 normal controls. The authors measured
	the fractional anisotropy {(FA)} and mean diffusivity {(MD)} along
	the pyramidal tracts from the internal capsules down to the pyramids.
	A mixed model regression analysis was used to compare {FA} and {MD}
	between the {ALS} and control groups. , Results: {FA} showed a downward
	linear trend from the cerebral peduncles to the pyramids and was
	lower in the {ALS} group than controls at multiple levels of the
	corticospinal tract. At the internal capsules, {FA} was higher on
	the right. {MD} showed an upward trend, progressing caudally from
	the internal capsules to the pyramids. {MD} was higher at the level
	of the internal capsule in the {ALS} group, but caudally this difference
	was not maintained. No correlations were found between clinical markers
	of disability and water diffusion indices. , Conclusions: These findings
	provide insights into the pathological processes of {ALS.} Differences
	in diffusion characteristics at different anatomical levels may relate
	to underlying tract architecture or the distribution of pathological
	damage in {ALS.} Further development may permit monitoring of progression

	Behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia patients and paired controls

	patients differed from controls on most tasks of the standard battery

  abstract = {Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) provides various imaging modes to
	study the brain. We tested the benefits of a joint analysis of multimodality
	MRI data in combination with a large-scale analysis that involved
	simultaneously all image voxels using joint independent components
	analysis (jICA) and compared the outcome to results using conventional
	voxel-by-voxel unimodality tests. Specifically, we designed a jICA
	to decompose multimodality MRI data into independent components that
	explain joint variations between the image modalities as well as
	variations across brain regions. We tested the jICA design on structural
	and perfusion-weighted MRI data from 12 patients diagnosed with behavioral
	variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) and 12 cognitively normal
	elderly individuals. While unimodality analyses showed widespread
	brain atrophy and hypoperfusion in the patients, jICA further revealed
	two significant joint components of variations between atrophy and
	hypoperfusion across brain regions. The 1st joint component revealed
	associated brain atrophy and hypoperfusion predominantly in the right
	brain hemisphere in behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia, and
	the 2nd joint component revealed greater atrophy relative to hypoperfusion
	affecting predominantly the left hemisphere in behavioral variant
	frontotemporal dementia. The patterns are consistent with the clinical
	symptoms of behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia that relate
	to asymmetric compromises of the left and right brain hemispheres.
	The joint components also revealed that that structural alterations
	can be associated with physiological alterations in spatially separated
	but potentially connected brain regions. Finally, jICA outperformed
	voxel-by-voxel unimodal tests significantly in terms of an effect
	size, separating the behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia patients
	from the controls. Taken together, the results demonstrate the benefit
	of multimodality MRI in conjunction with jICA for mapping neurodegeneration,
	which may lead ultimately to an improved diagnosis of behavioral
	variant frontotemporal dementia and other forms of neurodegenerative

  abstract = {Amyloid-? accumulation in the brain is thought to be one of the earliest
	events in Alzheimer's disease, possibly leading to synaptic dysfunction,
	neurodegeneration and cognitive/functional decline. The earliest
	detectable changes seen with neuroimaging appear to be amyloid-?
	accumulation detected by (11)C-labelled Pittsburgh compound B positron
	emission tomography imaging. However, some individuals tolerate high
	brain amyloid-? loads without developing symptoms, while others progressively
	decline, suggesting that events in the brain downstream from amyloid-?
	deposition, such as regional brain atrophy rates, play an important
	role. The main purpose of this study was to understand the relationship
	between the regional distributions of increased amyloid-? and the
	regional distribution of increased brain atrophy rates in patients
	with mild cognitive impairment. To simultaneously capture the spatial
	distributions of amyloid-? and brain atrophy rates, we employed the
	statistical concept of parallel independent component analysis, an
	effective method for joint analysis of multimodal imaging data. Parallel
	independent component analysis identified significant relationships
	between two patterns of amyloid-? deposition and atrophy rates: (i)
	increased amyloid-? burden in the left precuneus/cuneus and medial-temporal
	regions was associated with increased brain atrophy rates in the
	left medial-temporal and parietal regions; and (ii) in contrast,
	increased amyloid-? burden in bilateral precuneus/cuneus and parietal
	regions was associated with increased brain atrophy rates in the
	right medial temporal regions. The spatial distribution of increased
	amyloid-? and the associated spatial distribution of increased brain
	atrophy rates embrace a characteristic pattern of brain structures
	known for a high vulnerability to Alzheimer's disease pathology,
	encouraging for the use of (11)C-labelled Pittsburgh compound B positron
	emission tomography measures as early indicators of Alzheimer's disease.
	These results may begin to shed light on the mechanisms by which
	amyloid-? deposition leads to neurodegeneration and cognitive decline
	and the development of a more specific Alzheimer's disease-specific
	imaging signature for diagnosis and use of this knowledge in the
	development of new anti-therapies for Alzheimer's disease.},

	characteristics of the face to those of known individuals. The computational
	approach taken in this system is motivated by both physiology and
	information theory, as well as by the practical requirements of near-real-time
	performance and accuracy. Our approach treats the face recognition
	problem as an intrinsically two-dimensional (2-D) recognition problem
	rather than requiring recovery of three-dimensional geometry, taking
	advantage of the fact that faces are normally upright and thus may
	be described by a small set of 2-D characteristic views. The system
	functions by projecting face images onto a feature space that spans
	the significant variations among known face images. The significant
	features are known as "eigenfaces," because they are the eigenvectors
	(principal components) of the set of faces; they do not necessarily
	correspond to features such as eyes, ears, and noses. The projection
	operation characterizes an individual face by a weighted sum of the
	eigenface features, and so to recognize a particular face it is necessary
	only to compare these weights to those of known individuals. Some
	particular advantages of our approach are that it provides for the
	ability to learn and later recognize new faces in an unsupervised

  abstract = {We have developed a near-real-time computer system that can locate
	and track a subject's head, and then recognize the person by comparing
	characteristics of the face to those of known individuals. The computational
	approach taken in this system is motivated by both physiology and
	information theory, as well as by the practical requirements of near-real-time
	performance and accuracy. Our approach treats the face recognition
	problem as an intrinsically two-dimensional (2-D) recognition problem
	rather than requiring recovery of three-dimensional geometry, taking
	advantage of the fact that faces are normally upright and thus may
	be described by a small set of 2-D characteristic views. The system
	functions by projecting face images onto a feature space that spans
	the significant variations among known face images. The significant
	features are known as ''eigenfaces,'' because they are the eigenvectors
	(principal components) of the set of faces; they do not necessarily
	correspond to features such as eyes, ears, and noses. The projection
	operation characterizes an individual face by a weighted sum of the
	eigenface features, and so to recognize a particular face it is necessary
	only to compare these weights to those of known individuals. Some
	particular advantages of our approach are that it provides for the
	ability to learn and later recognize new faces in an unsupervised
	manner, and that it is easy to implement using a neural network architecture.},

  abstract = {Previous contributions to both the research and open source software
	communities detailed a generalization of a fast scalar field fitting
	technique for cubic B-splines based on the work originally proposed
	by Lee . One advantage of our proposed generalized B-spline fitting
	approach is its immediate application to a class of nonrigid registration
	techniques frequently employed in medical image analysis. Specifically,
	these registration techniques fall under the rubric of free-form
	deformation (FFD) approaches in which the object to be registered
	is embedded within a B-spline object. The deformation of the B-spline
	object describes the transformation of the image registration solution.
	Representative of this class of techniques, and often cited within
	the relevant community, is the formulation of Rueckert who employed
	cubic splines with normalized mutual information to study breast
	deformation. Similar techniques from various groups provided incremental
	novelty in the form of disparate explicit regularization terms, as
	well as the employment of various image metrics and tailored optimization
	methods. For several algorithms, the underlying gradient-based optimization
	retained the essential characteristics of Rueckert's original contribution.
	The contribution which we provide in this paper is two-fold: 1) the
	observation that the generic FFD framework is intrinsically susceptible
	to problematic energy topographies and 2) that the standard gradient
	used in FFD image registration can be modified to a well-understood
	preconditioned form which substantially improves performance. This
	is demonstrated with theoretical discussion and comparative evaluation
	experimentation.},

  abstract = {TDP-43 is a major component of the ubiquitinated inclusions that
	characterise amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal
	lobar degeneration (FTLD) with ubiquitin inclusions (FTLD-U). TDP-43
	is an RNA-binding and DNA-binding protein that has many functions
	and is encoded by the TAR DNA-binding protein gene (TARDBP) on chromosome
	1. Our aim was to investigate whether TARDBP is a candidate disease
	gene for familial ALS that is not associated with mutations in superoxide
	dismutase 1 (SOD1).TARDBP was sequenced in 259 patients with ALS,
	FTLD, or both. We used TaqMan-based SNP genotyping to screen for
	the identified variants in control groups matched to two kindreds
	of patients for age and ethnic origin. Additional clinical, genetic,
	and pathological assessments were made in these two families.We identified
	two variants in TARDBP, which would encode Gly290Ala and Gly298Ser
	forms of TDP-43, in two kindreds with familial ALS. The variants
	seem to be pathogenic because they co-segregated with disease in
	both families, were absent in controls, and were associated with
	TDP-43 neuropathology in both members of one of these families for
	whom CNS tissue was available.The Gly290Ala and Gly298Ser mutations
	are located in the glycine-rich domain of TDP-43, which regulates
	gene expression and mediates protein-protein interactions such as
	those with heterogeneous ribonucleoproteins. Owing to the varied
	and important cellular functions of TDP-43, these mutations might
	cause neurodegeneration through both gains and losses of function.
	The finding of pathogenic mutations in TARDBP implicates TDP-43 as
	an active mediator of neurodegeneration in TDP-43 proteinopathies,

  abstract = {Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is the second most common
	cause of presenile dementia. The predominant neuropathology is FTLD
	with TAR DNA-binding protein (TDP-43) inclusions (FTLD-TDP). FTLD-TDP
	is frequently familial, resulting from mutations in GRN (which encodes
	progranulin). We assembled an international collaboration to identify
	susceptibility loci for FTLD-TDP through a genome-wide association
	study of 515 individuals with FTLD-TDP. We found that FTLD-TDP associates
	with multiple SNPs mapping to a single linkage disequilibrium block
	on 7p21 that contains TMEM106B. Three SNPs retained genome-wide significance
	following Bonferroni correction (top SNP rs1990622, P = 1.08 x 10(-11);
	odds ratio, minor allele (C) 0.61, 95\% CI 0.53-0.71). The association
	replicated in 89 FTLD-TDP cases (rs1990622; P = 2 x 10(-4)). TMEM106B
	variants may confer risk of FTLD-TDP by increasing TMEM106B expression.
	TMEM106B variants also contribute to genetic risk for FTLD-TDP in
	individuals with mutations in GRN. Our data implicate variants in
	TMEM106B as a strong risk factor for FTLD-TDP, suggesting an underlying
	pathogenic mechanism.},

	chromosome 3 in a Danish FTLD family (FTD-3). In this family, a mutation
	in the acceptor splice site of exon 6 produced two aberrant transcripts

	of intron 5 (p.Met178ValfsX2) and a cryptic splicing event within
	exon 6 (p.Met178LeufsX30). Extensive mutation analysis of CHMP2B

  abstract = {In a genome-wide association study of frontotemporal lobar degeneration
	with pathological inclusions of TAR DNA-binding protein, significant
	association was obtained with three single nucleotide polymorphisms

	also suggested a potential modifying effect of TMEM106B on disease
	since the association was strongest in progranulin mutation carriers.
	Further, the risk effect seemed to correlate with increased TMEM106B
	expression in patients. In the present study, we sought to replicate
	these three findings using an independent Flanders-Belgian cohort
	of primarily clinically diagnosed patients with frontotemporal lobar
	degeneration (n = 288). We were able to confirm the association with
	TMEM106B with a P-value of 0.008 for rs1990622, the top marker from
	the genome-wide association study [odds ratio 0.75 (95\% confidence

	mapping suggested that the association was solely driven by the gene
	TMEM106B. Homozygous carriers of the TMEM106B protective alleles
	had a 50\% reduced risk of developing frontotemporal lobar degeneration.
	However, we were unable to detect a modifying effect of the TMEM106B

	carriers belonging to an extended, clinical and pathological well-documented
	founder family segregating a progranulin null mutation. Also, we

	a potential role of FUS in FTLD.We performed mutational analysis
	of FUS in 122 patients with FTLD and 15 patients with FTLD-ALS, as
	well as in 47 patients with ALS. Mutation screening was performed
	by sequencing of PCR amplicons of the 15 FUS exons.We identified

	amino acid substitution to be pathogenic. The patient did not have
	a proven family history of neurodegenerative brain disease. Further,
	we observed the known R521H mutation in 1 patient with ALS. No FUS
	mutations were detected in the patients with FTLD-ALS. While insertions/deletions

	may be tolerated.In a first analysis of FUS in patients with frontotemporal

	FTLD-TDP. Associations between TMEM106B genotype and ALS were investigated
	by comparing TMEM106B genotypes in ALS patients (n = 85) and normal
	controls (n = 553), and associations between TMEM106B genotype and
	clinical and pathologic features were explored using linear regression.
	Multivariate linear models were used to evaluate the contributions
	of TMEM106B genotype and TDP-43 pathology to cognitive performance
	in ALS as measured by a phonemic verbal fluency test. We found that
	TMEM106B genotypes did not differ between ALS patients and normal
	controls. However, protective alleles at TMEM106B were significantly
	associated with preserved cognition in ALS patients, with the strongest
	association seen under a major-allele-dominant genetic model. While
	lower TDP-43 pathology scores and protective alleles at TMEM106B
	both correlated with better cognitive scores, these factors were
	not correlated with each other and demonstrated independent effects.
	These findings implicate the FTLD-TDP risk gene TMEM106B in the development
	of cognitive impairment in ALS.},

  abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}
	
	To develop and validate a tool for Alzheimer's disease {(AD)} diagnosis
	in individual subjects using support vector machine {(SVM)-based}
	classification of structural {MR} {(sMR)} images.
	
	
	{BACKGROUND}
	
	Libraries of {sMR} scans of clinically well characterized subjects
	can be harnessed for the purpose of diagnosing new incoming subjects.
	
	
	{METHODS}
	
	One hundred ninety patients with probable {AD} were age- and gender-matched
	with 190 cognitively normal {(CN)} subjects. Three different classification
	models were implemented: Model I uses tissue densities obtained from
	{sMR} scans to give {STructural} Abnormality {iNDex} {(STAND)-score;}
	and Models {II} and {III} use tissue densities as well as covariates
	(demographics and Apolipoprotein E genotype) to give adjusted-{STAND}
	{(aSTAND)-score.} Data from 140 {AD} and 140 {CN} were used for training.
	The {SVM} parameter optimization and training were done by four-fold
	cross validation {(CV).} The remaining independent sample of 50 {AD}
	and 50 {CN} was used to obtain a minimally biased estimate of the
	generalization error of the algorithm.
	
	
	{RESULTS}
	
	The {CV} accuracy of Model {II} and Model {III} {aSTAND-scores} was
	88.5\% and 89.3\%, respectively, and the developed models generalized
	well on the independent test data sets. Anatomic patterns best differentiating
	the groups were consistent with the known distribution of neurofibrillary
	{AD} pathology.
	
	
	{CONCLUSIONS}
	
	This paper presents preliminary evidence that application of {SVM-based}
	classification of an individual {sMR} scan relative to a library
	of scans can provide useful information in individual subjects for
	diagnosis of {AD.} Including demographic and genetic information
	in the classification algorithm slightly improves diagnostic accuracy.},

	have so far been identified and it remains unclear how Nurr1 influences
	the development and function of dopaminergic neurons. To identify
	novel Nurr1 target genes we have used genome-wide expression profiling
	in rat midbrain primary cultures, enriched in dopaminergic neurons,
	following up-regulation of Nurr1 expression by depolarization. In
	this study we demonstrate that following depolarization the hyperexpression
	of Nurr1 and the brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) are phospholipase
	C- and protein kinase C-dependent. We show that Bdnf, which encodes
	a neurotrophin involved also in the phenotypic maturation of mDA
	neurons, is a novel Nurr1 target gene. By RNA interference experiments
	we show that a decreased Nurr1 expression is followed by tyrosine
	hydroxylase and BDNF mRNA and protein down-regulation. Reporter gene
	assay experiments performed on midbrain primary cultures using four
	Bdnf promoter constructs show that Bdnf is a direct target gene of
	Nurr1. Taken together, our findings suggest that Nurr1 might also

	associations between genetic variants and brain imaging phenotypes.
	While much work has focused on single scalar valued summaries of
	brain phenotype, accounting for the richness of imaging data requires
	a brain-wide, genome-wide search. In particular, the standard approach
	based on mass-univariate linear modelling (MULM) does not account
	for the structured patterns of correlations present in each domain.
	In this work, we propose sparse reduced rank regression (sRRR), a
	strategy for multivariate modelling of high-dimensional imaging responses
	(measurements taken over regions of interest or individual voxels)
	and genetic covariates (single nucleotide polymorphisms or copy number
	variations), which enforces sparsity in the regression coefficients.
	Such sparsity constraints ensure that the model performs simultaneous
	genotype and phenotype selection. Using simulation procedures that
	accurately reflect realistic human genetic variation and imaging
	correlations, we present detailed evaluations of the sRRR method
	in comparison with the more traditional MULM approach. In all settings
	considered, sRRR has better power to detect deleterious genetic variants
	compared to MULM. Important issues concerning model selection and
	connections to existing latent variable models are also discussed.
	This work shows that sRRR offers a promising alternative for detecting

	{NMF} is compatible with the intuitive notion of combining parts

	recognition by adding {NMF} constraint and classifier constraints
	to matrix factorization to get both intuitive features and good recognition
	results. Based on the framework, we present two novel subspace methods:
	Fisher Non-negative Matrix Factorization {(FNMF)} and {PCA} Non-negative
	Matrix Factorization {(PNMF).} {FNMF} adds both the non-negative
	constraint and the Fisher constraint to matrix factorization. The
	Fisher constraint maximizes the between-class scatter and minimizes
	the within-class scatter of face samples. Subsequently, {FNMF} improves
	the capability of face recognition. {PNMF} adds the non-negative
	constraint and characteristics of {PCA}, such as maximizing the variance
	of output coordinates, orthogonal bases, etc. to matrix factorization.
	Therefore, we can get intuitive features and desirable {PCA} characteristics.

  abstract = {We propose a simple but generally applicable approach to improving
	the accuracy of automatic image segmentation algorithms relative
	to manual segmentations. The approach is based on the hypothesis
	that a large fraction of the errors produced by automatic segmentation
	are systematic, i.e., occur consistently from subject to subject,
	and serves as a wrapper method around a given host segmentation method.
	The wrapper method attempts to learn the intensity, spatial and contextual
	patterns associated with systematic segmentation errors produced
	by the host method on training data for which manual segmentations
	are available. The method then attempts to correct such errors in
	segmentations produced by the host method on new images. One practical
	use of the proposed wrapper method is to adapt existing segmentation
	tools, without explicit modification, to imaging data and segmentation
	protocols that are different from those on which the tools were trained
	and tuned. An open-source implementation of the proposed wrapper
	method is provided, and can be applied to a wide range of image segmentation
	problems. The wrapper method is evaluated with four host brain MRI
	segmentation methods: hippocampus segmentation using FreeSurfer (Fischl
	et al., 2002); hippocampus segmentation using multi-atlas label fusion
	(Artaechevarria et al., 2009); brain extraction using BET (Smith,
	2002); and brain tissue segmentation using FAST (Zhang et al., 2001).
	The wrapper method generates 72\%, 14\%, 29\% and 21\% fewer erroneously
	segmented voxels than the respective host segmentation methods. In
	the hippocampus segmentation experiment with multi-atlas label fusion
	as the host method, the average Dice overlap between reference segmentations
	and segmentations produced by the wrapper method is 0.908 for normal
	controls and 0.893 for patients with mild cognitive impairment. Average
	Dice overlaps of 0.964, 0.905 and 0.951 are obtained for brain extraction,
	white matter segmentation and gray matter segmentation, respectively.},

	by progressive degeneration of upper motor neurons {(UMN)} and lower
	motor neurons {(LMN).} While {LMN} dysfunction can be confirmed by
	electromyography {(EMG)} and muscle biopsy, {UMN} involvement is

	diagnosis and monitoring of disease progression and therapeutic efficacy.
	Advanced magnetic resonance imaging {(MRI)} techniques, such as diffusion,

	of {ALS} and may have a role in the identification and monitoring
	of {UMN} pathology. This article provides an overview of these neuroimaging

	myopathy (IBM) associated with Paget's disease of the bone (PDB)

	a multisystem disorder, muscle weakness is the presenting symptom
	in greater than half of patients and an isolated symptom in 30\%.
	Patients with the full spectrum of the disease make up only 12\%
	of those affected; therefore it is important to consider and recognize
	IBMPFD in a neuromuscular clinic. The current review describes the
	skeletal muscle phenotype and common muscle histochemical features
	in IBMPFD. In addition to myopathic features; vacuolar changes and
	tubulofilamentous inclusions are found in a subset of patients. The
	most consistent findings are VCP, ubiquitin and TAR DNA-binding protein
	43 (TDP-43) positive inclusions. VCP is a ubiquitously expressed
	multifunctional protein that is a member of the AAA+ (ATPase associated
	with various activities) protein family. It has been implicated in
	multiple cellular functions ranging from organelle biogenesis to
	protein degradation. Although the role of VCP in skeletal muscle
	is currently unknown, it is clear that VCP mutations lead to the
	accumulation of ubiquitinated inclusions and protein aggregates in
	patient tissue, transgenic animals and in vitro systems. We suggest
	that IBMPFD is novel type of protein surplus myopathy. Instead of
	accumulating a poorly degraded and aggregated mutant protein as seen
	in some myofibrillar and nemaline myopathies, VCP mutations disrupt
	its normal role in protein homeostasis resulting in the accumulation
	of ubiquitinated and aggregated proteins that are deleterious to
	skeletal muscle.},

  abstract = {The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is an ongoing,
	longitudinal, multicenter study designed to develop clinical, imaging,
	genetic, and biochemical biomarkers for the early detection and tracking
	of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The study aimed to enroll 400 subjects
	with early mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 200 subjects with early
	AD, and 200 normal control subjects; $67 million funding was provided
	by both the public and private sectors, including the National Institute
	on Aging, 13 pharmaceutical companies, and 2 foundations that provided
	support through the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health.
	This article reviews all papers published since the inception of
	the initiative and summarizes the results as of February 2011. The
	major accomplishments of ADNI have been as follows: (1) the development
	of standardized methods for clinical tests, magnetic resonance imaging
	(MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and cerebrospinal fluid
	(CSF) biomarkers in a multicenter setting; (2) elucidation of the
	patterns and rates of change of imaging and CSF biomarker measurements
	in control subjects, MCI patients, and AD patients. CSF biomarkers
	are consistent with disease trajectories predicted by ?-amyloid cascade
	(Hardy, J Alzheimers Dis 2006;9(Suppl 3):151-3) and tau-mediated
	neurodegeneration hypotheses for AD, whereas brain atrophy and hypometabolism
	levels show predicted patterns but exhibit differing rates of change
	depending on region and disease severity; (3) the assessment of alternative
	methods of diagnostic categorization. Currently, the best classifiers
	combine optimum features from multiple modalities, including MRI,
	[(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET, CSF biomarkers, and clinical tests;
	(4) the development of methods for the early detection of AD. CSF
	biomarkers, ?-amyloid 42 and tau, as well as amyloid PET may reflect
	the earliest steps in AD pathology in mildly symptomatic or even
	nonsymptomatic subjects, and are leading candidates for the detection
	of AD in its preclinical stages; (5) the improvement of clinical
	trial efficiency through the identification of subjects most likely
	to undergo imminent future clinical decline and the use of more sensitive
	outcome measures to reduce sample sizes. Baseline cognitive and/or
	MRI measures generally predicted future decline better than other
	modalities, whereas MRI measures of change were shown to be the most
	efficient outcome measures; (6) the confirmation of the AD risk loci
	CLU, CR1, and PICALM and the identification of novel candidate risk
	loci; (7) worldwide impact through the establishment of ADNI-like
	programs in Europe, Asia, and Australia; (8) understanding the biology
	and pathobiology of normal aging, MCI, and AD through integration
	of ADNI biomarker data with clinical data from ADNI to stimulate
	research that will resolve controversies about competing hypotheses
	on the etiopathogenesis of AD, thereby advancing efforts to find
	disease-modifying drugs for AD; and (9) the establishment of infrastructure
	to allow sharing of all raw and processed data without embargo to
	interested scientific investigators throughout the world. The ADNI
	study was extended by a 2-year Grand Opportunities grant in 2009
	and a renewal of ADNI (ADNI-2) in October 2010 through to 2016, with
	enrollment of an additional 550 participants.},

	To assess regions and patterns of brain atrophy in patients with Parkinson

	{DESIGN}
	
	Images were quantified using a region-of-interest approach and voxel-based
	morphometry analysis. We used a high-dimensional pattern classification
	approach to delineate brain regions that collectively formed the
	Spatial Pattern of Abnormalities for Recognition of {PDD.}
	
	
	{SETTING}
	
	The Parkinson's Disease and Movement Disorders Center at the University
	of Pennsylvania.
	
	
	{SUBJECTS}
	
	Eighty-four {PD} patients (61 {PD-NC}, 12 {PD-MCI}, and 11 {PDD)}
	and 23 healthy control subjects {(HCs)} underwent magnetic resonance
	imaging of the brain.
	
	
	{RESULTS}
	
	The {PD-NC} patients did not demonstrate significant brain atrophy
	compared with {HCs.} Compared with {PD-NC} patients, {PD-MCI} patients
	had hippocampal atrophy (? = -0.37; P = .001), and {PDD} patients
	demonstrated hippocampal (? = -0.32; P = .004) and additional medial
	temporal lobe atrophy (? = -0.36; P = .003). The {PD-MCI} patients
	had a different pattern of atrophy compared with {PD-NC} patients
	{(P} = .04) and a similar pattern to that of {PDD} patients {(P}
	= .81), characterized by hippocampal, prefrontal cortex gray and
	white matter, occipital lobe gray and white matter, and parietal
	lobe white matter atrophy. In nondemented {PD} patients, there was
	a correlation between memory-encoding performance and hippocampal
	volume.
	
	
	{CONCLUSIONS}
	
	Hippocampal atrophy is a biomarker of initial cognitive decline in
	{PD}, including impaired memory encoding and storage, suggesting
	heterogeneity in the neural substrate of memory impairment. Use of
	a pattern classification approach may allow identification of diffuse
	regions of cortical gray and white matter atrophy early in the course
	of cognitive decline.},

  abstract = {Longitudinal MRI is a powerful tool that allows the assessment of
	progression of brain changes over multiple imaging time-points and
	has been increasingly employed in the study of neurodegenerative
	dementias, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD). Early studies demonstrated
	that AD was associated with increased rates of whole brain loss and
	hippocampal atrophy. A number of sophisticated voxel-level techniques
	have now been developed that have provided additional information
	describing regional atrophy over time in the temporal, parietal,
	and frontal lobes in AD. Studies have also focused on subjects in
	the prodromal phase of AD in order to describe the earliest changes
	that are occurring in the brain. Atrophy has been shown to start
	in the medial temporal lobes and fusiform gyrus at least 3 years
	before subjects reach a diagnosis of AD, and then spread to the posterior
	temporal lobes and parietal lobes, and then eventually the frontal
	lobes. These patterns of atrophy correlate well with the progression
	of neurofibrillary tangles observed on pathology. Rates of atrophy
	have also been shown to accelerate over the course of the disease
	as a subject progresses from cognitively normal to a diagnosis of
	AD. Similar techniques have also been applied to other neurodegenerative
	diseases, such as frontotemporal dementia which show higher rates
	of atrophy and different patterns of progression to those observed
	in AD. Hence, longitudinal MRI shows promise as a biomarker of disease
	progression in neurodegenerative disease.},

  abstract = {{A}lzheimer disease (AD) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD)
	are both common degenerative dementias in the under 65 age group.
	Although clinical criteria have been defined for both diseases, there
	is considerable overlap in clinical features, and hence, diagnosis
	still can be very difficult particularly in the early stages of the
	disease. As a result, there has been increasing interest in using
	magnetic resonance imaging to better characterize these diseases
	and to aid in diagnosis. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) is an automated
	technique that assesses patterns of regional gray matter atrophy
	on magnetic resonance imaging between 2 groups of subjects. It is
	unbiased in that it looks throughout the whole brain and does not
	require any a priori assumptions concerning which structures to assess,
	giving it a significant advantage over traditional region of interest-based
	methods. Voxel-based morphometry has been widely used to assess patterns
	of regional atrophy in subjects with AD and FTLD. These studies have
	demonstrated specific patterns of regional loss in both diseases,
	compared the 2 diseases to look for differences that could be diagnostically
	useful, and have correlated regions of gray matter loss to cognitive
	and behavioral deficits in these subjects. This article will review
	the findings of these studies and discuss the role of VBM in these
	neurodegenerative diseases.},

  abstract = {Neurodegenerative disorders are pathologically characterized by the
	deposition of abnormal proteins in the brain. It is likely that future
	treatment trials will target the underlying protein biochemistry
	and it is therefore increasingly important to be able to distinguish
	between different pathologies during life. The aim of this study
	was to determine whether rates of brain atrophy differ in neurodegenerative
	dementias that vary by pathological diagnoses and characteristic
	protein biochemistry. Fifty-six autopsied subjects were identified
	with a clinical diagnosis of dementia and two serial head {M}{R}{I}.
	Subjects were subdivided based on pathological diagnoses into {A}lzheimer's
	disease, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), mixed {A}lzheimer's disease/DLB,
	frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin-only-immunoreactive
	changes (FTLD-U), corticobasal degeneration (CBD) and progressive
	supranuclear palsy (PSP). Twenty-five controls were matched by age,
	gender and scan interval, to the study cohort. The boundary-shift
	integral was used to calculate change over time in whole brain (BBSI)
	and ventricular volume (VBSI). All BSI results were annualized by
	adjusting for scan interval. The rates of whole brain atrophy and
	ventricular expansion were significantly increased compared to controls
	in the {A}lzheimer's disease, mixed {A}lzheimer's disease/DLB, FTLD-U,
	CBD and PSP groups. However, atrophy rates in the DLB group were
	not significantly different from control rates of atrophy. The largest
	rates of atrophy were observed in the CBD group which had a BBSI
	of 2.3\% and VBSI of 16.2\%. The CBD group had significantly greater
	rates of BBSI and VBSI than the DLB, mixed {A}lzheimer's disease/DLB,
	{A}lzheimer's disease and PSP groups, with a similar trend observed
	when compared to the FTLD-U group. The FTLD-U group showed the next
	largest rates with a BBSI of 1.7\% and VBSI of 9.6\% which were both
	significantly greater than the DLB group. There was no significant
	difference in the rates of atrophy between the {A}lzheimer's disease,
	mixed {A}lzheimer's disease/DLB and PSP groups, which all showed
	similar rates of atrophy; BBSI of 1.1, 1.3 and 1.0\% and VBSI of
	8.3, 7.2 and 10.9\%, respectively. Rates of atrophy therefore differ
	according to the pathological diagnoses and underlying protein biochemistry.
	While rates are unlikely to be useful in differentiating {A}lzheimer's
	disease from cases with mixed {A}lzheimer's disease/DLB pathology,
	they demonstrate important pathophysiological differences between
	DLB and those with mixed {A}lzheimer's disease/DLB and {A}lzheimer's
	disease pathology, and between those with CBD and PSP pathology.},

	control subjects (Braak stages 0 through II). RESULTS: In pairwise
	comparisons with Braak stages 0 through II, a graded response was

	The lack of findings in Braak stages III and IV could be because

	(FTD) are difficult to predict in vivo. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether
	different pathologic substrates of FTD have distinct patterns of
	regional atrophy on magnetic resonance imaging ({M}{R}{I}). DESIGN:
	Retrospective case study. SETTING: The Institute of Neurology, University
	College London, and the Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London.Patients
	Twenty-one cases of FTD selected on pathologic grounds (9 with ubiquitin-positive
	[tau- and alpha-synuclein-negative] inclusions [FTD-U], 7 with Pick
	disease [PiD], and 5 with familial FTD with tau exon 10+16 mutations
	[tau exon 10+16]) and 20 healthy controls were studied. MAIN OUTCOME
	MEASURES: Patterns of gray matter atrophy in each group as assessed
	by voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and a blinded visual assessment
	of each {M}{R}{I} study. RESULTS: All pathologic substrates were
	associated with atrophy that involved the inferior and medial temporal
	and inferior frontal lobes. Additionally, specific VBM signatures
	were identified for each subgroup: FTD-U was associated with asymmetric
	(left > right) temporal lobe atrophy, PiD was associated with severe
	dorsolateral bifrontal atrophy, and tau exon 10+16 was associated
	with asymmetric (right > left) medial temporal lobe atrophy. The
	VBM findings were supported by blinded visual assessment. CONCLUSION:
	These findings suggest that {M}{R}{I} patterns of regional gray matter
	atrophy constitute signatures of tissue pathology in FTD.},

  abstract = {In recent work, several authors have introduced methods for sparse
	canonical correlation analysis (sparse {CCA).} Suppose that two sets
	of measurements are available on the same set of observations. Sparse
	{CCA} is a method for identifying sparse linear combinations of the
	two sets of variables that are highly correlated with each other.
	It has been shown to be useful in the analysis of high-dimensional
	genomic data, when two sets of assays are available on the same set
	of samples. In this paper, we propose two extensions to the sparse
	{CCA} methodology. (1) Sparse {CCA} is an unsupervised method; that
	is, it does not make use of outcome measurements that may be available
	for each observation (e.g., survival time or cancer subtype). We
	propose an extension to sparse {CCA}, which we call sparse supervised
	{CCA}, which results in the identification of linear combinations
	of the two sets of variables that are correlated with each other
	and associated with the outcome. (2) It is becoming increasingly
	common for researchers to collect data on more than two assays on
	the same set of samples; for instance, {SNP}, gene expression, and
	{DNA} copy number measurements may all be available. We develop sparse
	multiple {CCA} in order to extend the sparse {CCA} methodology to
	the case of more than two data sets. We demonstrate these new methods
	on simulated data and on a recently published and publicly available
	diffuse large B-cell lymphoma data set. Copyright © 2009 The Berkeley

	for computing a rank-K approximation for a matrix. We approximate

	where d(k), u(k), and v(k) minimize the squared Frobenius norm of
	X - {circumflexX}, subject to penalties on u(k) and v(k). This results
	in a regularized version of the singular value decomposition. Of
	particular interest is the use of L(1)-penalties on u(k) and v(k),
	which yields a decomposition of X using sparse vectors. We show that
	when the {PMD} is applied using an L(1)-penalty on v(k) but not on
	u(k), a method for sparse principal components results. In fact,
	this yields an efficient algorithm for the {"SCoTLASS"} proposal
	{(Jolliffe} and others 2003) for obtaining sparse principal components.
	This method is demonstrated on a publicly available gene expression
	data set. We also establish connections between the {SCoTLASS} method
	for sparse principal component analysis and the method of Zou and
	others (2006). In addition, we show that when the {PMD} is applied
	to a cross-products matrix, it results in a method for penalized
	canonical correlation analysis {(CCA).} We apply this penalized {CCA}
	method to simulated data and to a genomic data set consisting of

  abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease {(IBD)} is an inflammatory condition that
	affects the gastrointestinal tract. The solute carrier {(SLC)} superfamily
	of transporters comprise proteins involved in the uptake of drugs,
	hormones, and other biologically active compounds. The purpose of
	this study was to determine the {mRNA} expression levels of 15 solute
	carrier transporters in two regions of the intestine in {IBD} patients.
	Endoscopic biopsy specimens were taken from two locations (terminal
	ileum and colon) for histological examination and {RNA} extraction.
	We quantitatively measured the {mRNA} expression of 15 {SLC} transporters
	in 107 {IBD} patients (53 with Crohn's disease and 54 with ulcerative
	colitis) and 23 control subjects. {mRNA} expression was evaluated
	using the quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction
	technique. We observed that in the ileum of {IBD} patients, {mRNA}
	levels for serotonin transporter, equilibrative nucleoside transporter
	{(ENT)} 1, {ENT2}, and organic anion-transporting polypeptide {(OATP)}
	{2B1} were significantly elevated, whereas levels for apical sodium-dependent
	bile acid transporter {(ASBT)} and organic zwitterion/cation transporter
	{(OCTN)} 2 were significantly lower. In colon, {mRNA} levels for
	{ENT1}, {ENT2}, concentrative nucleoside transporter {(CNT)} 2, {OATP2B1},
	and {OATP4A1} were significantly higher, whereas {mRNA} levels for
	{OCTN2} were significantly decreased. In inflamed colon of {IBD}
	patients the {mRNA} expression levels of {ENT1}, {ENT2}, {CNT2},
	{OATP2B1}, {OATP4A1}, and peptide transporter 1 were significantly
	higher. We conclude that intestinal {SLC} {mRNA} levels are dysregulated
	in {IBD} patients, which may be linked to the inflammation of the
	tissue and provides an indication about the role of inflammatory
	signaling in regulation of {SLC} expression.},

	improved accuracy in a verbal WM task, improved verbal WM-span and
	symptom reduction as measured by the BPRS global score and the BPRS

  abstract = {We propose a novel framework for the automatic propagation of a set

	population of subjects. A manifold is learned from a coordinate system
	embedding that allows the identification of neighborhoods which contain
	images that are similar based on a chosen criterion. Within the new
	coordinate system, the initial set of atlases is propagated to all
	images through a succession of multi-atlas segmentation steps. This
	breaks the problem of registering images that are very "dissimilar"
	down into a problem of registering a series of images that are "similar".
	At the same time, it allows the potentially large deformation between
	the images to be modeled as a sequence of several smaller deformations.
	We applied the proposed method to an exemplar region centered around
	the hippocampus from a set of 30 atlases based on images from young
	healthy subjects and a dataset of 796 images from elderly dementia
	patients and age-matched controls enrolled in the Alzheimer's Disease
	Neuroimaging Initiative {(ADNI).} We demonstrate an increasing gain
	in accuracy of the new method, compared to standard multi-atlas segmentation,
	with increasing distance between the target image and the initial
	set of atlases in the coordinate embedding, i.e., with a greater
	difference between atlas and image. For the segmentation of the hippocampus
	on 182 images for which a manual segmentation is available, we achieved
	an average overlap {(Dice} coefficient) of 0.85 with the manual reference.

	a rodent model of social stress, the present study was designed to
	identify putative neurobiological substrates that contribute to social
	stress-induced psychopathology and factors that influence or predict
	vulnerability. The resident-intruder model of defeat was used as
	a social stressor in adult male Sprague Dawley rats. The average
	latency to assume a subordinate posture (signaling defeat) over seven
	daily defeat exposures was calculated and examined with respect to
	endpoints of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal activity, components
	of the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) system, and behaviors
	that are relevant to human depression. In the present studies, a
	bimodal distribution emerged in an otherwise homogeneous population
	of Sprague Dawley rats such that 42\% of rats exhibited short defeat
	latencies (<300 sec), whereas 58\% of rats resisted defeat and exhibited
	longer latencies (>300 sec). These two phenotypes were associated
	with distinct endocrine and behavioral profiles as well as differences
	in components of the CRF system. Notably, the short-latency subpopulation
	exhibited hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal dysregulation and behavior
	similar to that observed in melancholic depression. Examination of
	components of the CRF system suggested that proactive behavior in
	resisting defeat exhibited by long-latency rats was associated with
	decreased efficacy of CRF. Together, these data suggest that inherent
	differences in stress reactivity, perhaps as a result of differences
	in CRF regulation, may predict long-term consequences of social stress
	and vulnerability to depressive-like symptoms.},

  abstract = {We consider the problem of automatically recognizing human faces
	from frontal views with varying expression and illumination, as well
	as occlusion and disguise. We cast the recognition problem as one
	of classifying among multiple linear regression models and argue
	that new theory from sparse signal representation offers the key
	to addressing this problem. Based on a sparse representation computed
	by C$^{\textrm{1}}$-minimization, we propose a general classification
	algorithm for (image-based) object recognition. This new framework
	provides new insights into two crucial issues in face recognition:
	feature extraction and robustness to occlusion. For feature extraction,
	we show that if sparsity in the recognition problem is properly harnessed,
	the choice of features is no longer critical. What is critical, however,
	is whether the number of features is sufficiently large and whether
	the sparse representation is correctly computed. Unconventional features
	such as downsampled images and random projections perform just as
	well as conventional features such as eigenfaces and Laplacianfaces,
	as long as the dimension of the feature space surpasses certain threshold,
	predicted by the theory of sparse representation. This framework
	can handle errors due to occlusion and corruption uniformly by exploiting
	the fact that these errors are often sparse with respect to the standard
	(pixel) basis. The theory of sparse representation helps predict
	how much occlusion the recognition algorithm can handle and how to
	choose the training images to maximize robustness to occlusion. We
	conduct extensive experiments on publicly available databases to
	verify the efficacy of the proposed algorithm and corroborate the
	above claims.},

	Although white matter tractography and eigenvector color maps provide
	visually appealing displays of white matter tract organization, they
	do not easily lend themselves to quantitative and statistical analysis.
	In this study, a set of visual and quantitative tools for the investigation
	of tensor orientations in the human brain was developed. Visual tools
	included rose diagrams, which are spherical coordinate histograms
	of the major eigenvector directions, and {3D} scatterplots of the
	major eigenvector angles. A scatter matrix of major eigenvector directions
	was used to describe the distribution of major eigenvectors in a
	defined anatomic region. A measure of eigenvector dispersion was
	developed to describe the degree of eigenvector coherence in the
	selected region. These tools were used to evaluate directional organization
	and the interhemispheric symmetry of {DT-MRI} data in five healthy
	human brains and two patients with infiltrative diseases of the white
	matter tracts. In normal anatomical white matter tracts, a high degree
	of directional coherence and interhemispheric symmetry was observed.
	The infiltrative diseases appeared to alter the eigenvector properties
	of affected white matter tracts, showing decreased eigenvector coherence
	and interhemispheric symmetry. This novel approach distills the rich,
	{3D} information available from the diffusion tensor into a form
	that lends itself to quantitative analysis and statistical hypothesis

	or at the University of California, San Francisco. We assessed clinical
	and demographic features; cognitive functioning at presentation;

	(n = 35) had a median survival time of 96 months (95\% CI: 72-114
	months), whereas the tau-positive group (n = 36) had a median survival
	time of 72 months (95\% CI: 60-84 months). Patients with tau-positive

	CONCLUSIONS: Tau-positive pathology represents a significant risk

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)
	are at high risk of progression to Alzheimer's dementia. Identifying
	MCI individuals with high likelihood of conversion to dementia and
	the associated biosignatures has recently received increasing attention
	in AD research. Different biosignatures for AD (neuroimaging, demographic,
	genetic and cognitive measures) may contain complementary information
	for diagnosis and prognosis of AD. METHODS: We have conducted a comprehensive
	study using a large number of samples from the Alzheimer's Disease
	Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) to test the power of integrating various
	baseline data for predicting the conversion from MCI to probable
	AD and identifying a small subset of biosignatures for the prediction
	and assess the relative importance of different modalities in predicting
	MCI to AD conversion. We have employed sparse logistic regression
	with stability selection for the integration and selection of potential
	predictors. Our study differs from many of the other ones in three
	important respects: (1) we use a large cohort of MCI samples that
	are unbiased with respect to age or education status between case
	and controls (2) we integrate and test various types of baseline
	data available in ADNI including MRI, demographic, genetic and cognitive
	measures and (3) we apply sparse logistic regression with stability
	selection to ADNI data for robust feature selection. RESULTS: We
	have used 319 MCI subjects from ADNI that had MRI measurements at
	the baseline and passed quality control, including 177 MCI Non-converters
	and 142 MCI Converters. Conversion was considered over the course
	of a 4-year follow-up period. A combination of 15 features (predictors)
	including those from MRI scans, APOE genotyping, and cognitive measures
	achieves the best prediction with an AUC score of 0.8587. These results
	also demonstrate the effectiveness of stability selection for feature
	selection in the context of sparse logistic regression.},

  abstract = {Motivation: There is a great need to develop analytical methodology
	to analyze and to exploit the information contained in gene expression
	data. Because of the large number of genes and the complexity of
	biological networks, clustering is a useful exploratory technique
	for analysis of gene expression data. Other classical techniques,
	such as principal component analysis {(PCA)}, have also been applied
	to analyze gene expression data. Using different data analysis techniques
	and different clustering algorithms to analyze the same data set
	can lead to very different conclusions. Our goal is to study the
	effectiveness of principal components {(PCs)} in capturing cluster
	structure. Specifically, using both real and synthetic gene expression
	data sets, we compared the quality of clusters obtained from the
	original data to the quality of clusters obtained after projecting
	onto subsets of the principal component axes. Results: Our empirical
	study showed that clustering with the {PCs} instead of the original
	variables does not necessarily improve, and often degrades, cluster
	quality. In particular, the first few {PCs} (which contain most of
	the variation in the data) do not necessarily capture most of the
	cluster structure. We also showed that clustering with {PCs} has
	different impact on different algorithms and different similarity
	metrics. Overall, we would not recommend {PCA} before clustering
	except in special circumstances.},

	Second, visual feature knowledge is degraded in patients with SD

	activation of microglia and astrocytes than WT, and their hippocampal
	and thalamic neurons accumulated cytosolic phosphorylated transactivation
	response element DNA binding protein-43. Thus, PGRN is a key regulator

	(FTD) has never been systematically studied using diffusion-weighted
	imaging (DWI). We studied FTD patients using DWI to determine whether
	microstructural changes in white matter can be detected in vivo.
	MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirteen FTD patients and 15 aged healthy
	subjects were studied. Mean diffusivity (MD) abnormalities in 28
	white matter regions were visually evaluated. In addition, MD values
	in 10 white matter regions relative to that in the ipsilateral postcentral
	gyrus were measured. The results were compared between healthy subjects
	and FTD patients. RESULTS: The visual rating resulted in a significant
	MD elevation in FTD patients in the bilateral high superior frontal
	gyri, right orbitofrontal gyrus, bilateral anterior temporal lobes,
	and left middle temporal lobe (P < .01, respectively). Relative MD
	comparison revealed a significant MD elevation in FTD patients in
	the bilateral high superior frontal gyri, bilateral orbitofrontal
	gyri, and bilateral anterior temporal lobes (P < .05 after Bonferroni
	correction, respectively). CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated white
	matter MD abnormalities in FTD patients. It was suggested that the

	the overlying cortex.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Magnetic resonance ({M}{R}{I}) studies rely on sulcal
	boundaries to delineate the human entorhinal cortex (EC) and typically
	show that EC size is reduced in {A}lzheimer's disease (AD) and a
	predictor of future dementia. However, it is unknown if variations
	in the EC sulcal patterns are associated with AD. We classified the
	lateral EC sulcal boundary as either a rhinal or collateral pattern
	and tested the hypotheses that the rhinal pattern was (1) more common
	in AD and (2) associated with a smaller EC size. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN:
	{M}{R}{I} was used to determine the prevalence of the rhinal and
	collateral EC patterns in 421 subjects (212 AD, 107 old normal (ONL),
	and 102 young NL (YNL). Anatomical validation studies of normal subjects
	were conducted at postmortem in 34 brain hemispheres and in vivo
	with 21 {M}{R}{I} volume studies. EC pattern reliability was studied
	with {M}{R}{I} in both cross-sectional and longitudinal designs.
	PRINCIPAL OBSERVATIONS: The rhinal pattern was more frequent in the
	right hemisphere in AD (47\%) compared with ONL (28\%, odds ratio
	= 2.25, P = 0.001). EC pattern was not related to ApoE genotype.
	The validations showed that the EC sulcal pattern was not associated
	with the neuronal number, surface area, or volume of the EC. In patients
	with antemortem {M}{R}{I} studied at postmortem it was equivalently
	determined, that EC patterns are reliably determined on {M}{R}{I}
	and do not change with the progressive atrophy of AD. CONCLUSIONS:
	The data indicate that the right hemisphere rhinal pattern is over
	represented in AD as compared with control. However, in normal subjects
	the EC rhinal pattern is not associated with a diminished EC tissue
	size. It remains to be demonstrated if the right EC rhinal sulcus
	pattern association with AD reflects genetic or developmental influences.},

  abstract = {Accurate prediction of clinical changes of mild cognitive impairment
	(MCI) patients, including both qualitative change (i.e., conversion
	to Alzheimer's disease (AD)) and quantitative change (i.e., cognitive
	scores) at future time points, is important for early diagnosis of
	AD and for monitoring the disease progression. In this paper, we
	propose to predict future clinical changes of MCI patients by using
	both baseline and longitudinal multimodality data. To do this, we
	first develop a longitudinal feature selection method to jointly
	select brain regions across multiple time points for each modality.
	Specifically, for each time point, we train a sparse linear regression
	model by using the imaging data and the corresponding clinical scores,
	with an extra 'group regularization' to group the weights corresponding
	to the same brain region across multiple time points together and
	to allow for selection of brain regions based on the strength of
	multiple time points jointly. Then, to further reflect the longitudinal
	changes on the selected brain regions, we extract a set of longitudinal
	features from the original baseline and longitudinal data. Finally,
	we combine all features on the selected brain regions, from different
	modalities, for prediction by using our previously proposed multi-kernel
	SVM. We validate our method on 88 ADNI MCI subjects, with both MRI
	and FDG-PET data and the corresponding clinical scores (i.e., MMSE
	and ADAS-Cog) at 5 different time points. We first predict the clinical
	scores (MMSE and ADAS-Cog) at 24-month by using the multimodality
	data at previous time points, and then predict the conversion of
	MCI to AD by using the multimodality data at time points which are
	at least 6-month ahead of the conversion. The results on both sets
	of experiments show that our proposed method can achieve better performance
	in predicting future clinical changes of MCI patients than the conventional

	it has been achieved using low-dimensional registration methods in

	the use of high-dimensional normalization approaches by generating
	evidence of their impact on the findings of such studies. Using an
	ongoing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) study, we evaluated three
	normalization methods representing the current range of available
	approaches: low-dimensional normalization using the fractional anisotropy

	normalization using full tensor information. Each method was assessed
	in terms of its ability to detect significant differences between
	ALS patients and controls. Our findings suggest that inadequate normalization
	with low-dimensional approaches can result in insufficient removal
	of shape differences which in turn can confound FA differences in
	a complex manner, and that utilizing high-dimensional normalization
	can both significantly minimize the confounding effect of shape differences
	to FA differences and provide a more complete description of WM differences
	in terms of both size and tissue architecture differences. We also
	found that high-dimensional approaches, by leveraging full tensor
	features instead of tensor-derived indices, can further improve the

	both the image similarity and the smoothness of the transformation
	across region boundaries. The image similarity enables explicit orientation
	optimization by incorporating tensor reorientation, which is necessary
	for warping diffusion tensor images. The objective function is formulated
	in a way that allows explicit implementation of analytic derivatives
	to drive fast and accurate optimization using the conjugate gradient
	method. By explicitly optimizing tensor reorientation, the algorithm
	is designed to take advantage of similarity measures comparing tensors
	as a whole. The optimal transformation is hierarchically refined
	in a subdivision framework. A comparison with affine registration
	for inter-subject normalization of 8 subjects shows that the proposed
	algorithm improves the alignment of several major white matter structures

	is proposed for robust segmentation in the presence of weak/misleading
	appearance cues. Owing to the less trustable appearance information,
	this method focuses on the effective shape modeling with two contributions.
	First, a shape composition method is designed to incorporate shape
	prior on-the-fly. Based on two sparsity observations, this method
	is robust to false appearance information and adaptive to statistically
	insignificant shape modes. Second, shape priors are modeled and used
	in a hierarchical fashion. More specifically, by using affinity propagation
	method, our deformable surface is divided into multiple partitions,
	on which local shape models are built independently. This scheme
	facilitates a more compact shape prior modeling and hence a more
	robust and efficient segmentation. Our deformable model is applied
	on two very diverse segmentation problems, liver segmentation in
	{PET-CT} images and rodent brain segmentation in {MR} images. Compared

  abstract = {The finite mixture {(FM)} model is the most commonly used model for
	statistical segmentation of brain magnetic resonance {(MR)} images
	because of its simple mathematical form and the piecewise constant
	nature of ideal brain {MR} images. However, being a histogram-based
	model, the {FM} has an intrinsic limitation-no spatial information
	is taken into account. This causes the {FM} model to work only on
	well-defined images with low levels of noise; unfortunately, this
	is often not the case due to artifacts such as partial volume effect
	and bias field distortion. Under these conditions, {FM} model-based
	methods produce unreliable results. In this paper, we propose a novel
	hidden Markov random field {(HMRF)} model, which is a stochastic
	process generated by a {MRF} whose state sequence cannot be observed
	directly but which can be indirectly estimated through observations.

  abstract = {The finite mixture (FM) model is the most commonly used model for
	statistical segmentation of brain magnetic resonance (MR) images
	because of its simple mathematical form and the piecewise constant
	nature of ideal brain MR images. However, being a histogram-based
	model, the FM has an intrinsic limitation--no spatial information
	is taken into account. This causes the FM model to work only on well-defined
	images with low levels of noise; unfortunately, this is often not
	the the case due to artifacts such as partial volume effect and bias
	field distortion. Under these conditions, FM model-based methods
	produce unreliable results. In this paper, we propose a novel hidden
	Markov random field (HMRF) model, which is a stochastic process generated
	by a MRF whose state sequence cannot be observed directly but which
	can be indirectly estimated through observations. Mathematically,
	it can be shown that the FM model is a degenerate version of the
	HMRF model. The advantage of the HMRF model derives from the way
	in which the spatial information is encoded through the mutual influences
	of neighboring sites. Although MRF modeling has been employed in
	MR image segmentation by other researchers, most reported methods
	are limited to using MRF as a general prior in an FM model-based
	approach. To fit the HMRF model, an EM algorithm is used. We show
	that by incorporating both the HMRF model and the EM algorithm into
	a HMRF-EM framework, an accurate and robust segmentation can be achieved.
	More importantly, the HMRF-EM framework can easily be combined with
	other techniques. As an example, we show how the bias field correction

  abstract = {Owning to its clinical accessibility, T1-weighted {MRI} {(Magnetic}
	Resonance Imaging) has been extensively studied in the past decades
	for prediction of Alzheimer's disease {(AD)} and mild cognitive impairment
	{(MCI).} The volumes of gray matter {(GM)}, white matter {(WM)} and
	cerebrospinal fluid {(CSF)} are the most commonly used measurements,
	resulting in many successful applications. It has been widely observed
	that disease-induced structural changes may not occur at isolated
	spots, but in several inter-related regions. Therefore, for better
	characterization of brain pathology, we propose in this paper a means
	to extract inter-regional correlation based features from local volumetric
	measurements. Specifically, our approach involves constructing an
	anatomical brain network for each subject, with each node representing
	a Region of Interest {(ROI)} and each edge representing Pearson correlation
	of tissue volumetric measurements between {ROI} pairs. As second
	order volumetric measurements, network features are more descriptive
	but also more sensitive to noise. To overcome this limitation, a
	hierarchy of {ROIs} is used to suppress noise at different scales.
	Pairwise interactions are considered not only for {ROIs} with the
	same scale in the same layer of the hierarchy, but also for {ROIs}
	across different scales in different layers. To address the high
	dimensionality problem resulting from the large number of network
	features, a supervised dimensionality reduction method is further
	employed to embed a selected subset of features into a low dimensional
	feature space, while at the same time preserving discriminative information.
	We demonstrate with experimental results the efficacy of this embedding
	strategy in comparison with some other commonly used approaches.
	In addition, although the proposed method can be easily generalized
	to incorporate other metrics of regional similarities, the benefits
	of using Pearson correlation in our application are reinforced by
	the experimental results. Without requiring new sources of information,
	our proposed approach improves the accuracy of {MCI} prediction from
	(of conventional volumetric features) to (of hierarchical network
	features), evaluated using data sets randomly drawn from the {ADNI}
	{(Alzheimer's} Disease Neuroimaging Initiative) dataset.},

	to resolve their phylogenetic relationships. However, previous analyses
	based on limited samples of nuclear genes or mitochondrial {DNA}
	sequences have generated results that were either inconsistent with
	one another, weakly supported, or highly sensitive to analytical
	conditions. Here, we present strongly supported results based upon
	over 1.4 Mb of an aligned {DNA} sequence matrix from 110 single-copy
	nuclear protein-coding genes of 21 Cetartiodactyla species, which
	represent major Cetartiodactyla lineages, and three species of Perissodactyla
	and Carnivora as outgroups. Phylogenetic analysis of this newly developed
	genomic sequence data using a codon-based model and recently developed
	models of the rate autocorrelation resolved the phylogenetic relationships
	of the major cetartiodactylan lineages and of those lineages with
	a high degree of confidence. Cetacea was found to nest within Artiodactyla
	as the sister group of Hippopotamidae, and Tylopoda was corroborated
	as the sole base clade of Cetartiodactyla. Within Cetacea, the monophyletic
	status of Odontoceti relative to Mysticeti, the basal position of
	Physeteroidea in Odontoceti, the non-monophyly of the river dolphins,
	and the sister relationship between Delphinidae and {Monodontidae+Phocoenidae}
	were strongly supported. In particular, the groups of Tursiops (bottlenose
	dolphins) and Stenella (spotted dolphins) were validated as unnatural
	groups. Additionally, a very narrow time frame of ?3 My (million
	years) was found for the rapid diversification of delphinids in the
	late Miocene, which made it difficult to resolve the phylogenetic
	relationships within the Delphinidae, especially for previous studies
	with limited data sets. The present study provides a statistically
	well-supported phylogenetic framework of Cetartiodactyla, which represents
	an important step toward ending some of the often-heated, century-long
	debate on their evolution.},

  abstract = {In this paper we describe a new methodology for defining brain regions-of-interset
	(ROIs) in functional magnetic resonance imaging (f{M}{R}{I}) data.
	The ROIs are defined based on their functional connectivity to other
	ROIs, i.e. ROIs are defined as sets of voxels with similar connectivity
	patterns to other ROIs. The method relies on 1) a spatially regularized
	canonical correlation analysis for identifying maximally correlated
	signals, which are not due to correlated noise; 2) a test for merging
	ROIs which have similar connectivity patterns to the other ROIs;
	and 3) a graph-cuts optimization for assigning voxels to ROIs. Since
	our method is fully connectivity-based, the extracted ROIs and their
	corresponding time signals are ideally suited for a subsequent brain
	connectivity analysis.},
